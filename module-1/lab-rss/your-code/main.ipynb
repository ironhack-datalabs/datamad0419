This, of course, is in an effort to move forward the culture of open source, from static code branches sitting in source trees to living and evolving useful systems ready for live interaction, still egalitarian and open access in nature.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At the heart of this vision lie practically immutable accounting systems that store the widely accepted state of the world to ensure global integrity. Large visions are rarely achieved in one fell swoop and are instead typically realized through the emergence of solutions for related and meaningful short-term problems. The volatility problem is one such important candidate.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Due to the nascency of cryptocurrency markets, volatility has remained a staple for both outside observers and users. Although traders may fare well from the conditions, those wishing to use the assets in particular and unlock the true value of these accounting systems may have a different experience altogether. An asset bought as a medium of exchange (MoE) may lose its value before any value from spending that asset has truly been captured.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The volatility problem is important to solve because its resolution in the short-term unlocks the financial and technical engineering groundwork necessary for cheap, swift, secure, and disintermediated global payment systems based on blockchains. Users of these systems will be able to transact seamlessly with peers at a far cheaper rate and with a dramatic increase of security due to the nature of these cryptographic systems. In the long term, solving this problem will vastly reduce the barrier to entry for use of smart contract-based services on public, consortium, and private blockchains—truly unlocking the automation value these technologies have to offer.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A cryptocurrency-based contender that has appeared in order to solve this crisis is called a stablecoin. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that is pegged by various means to a traditional fiat currency to maintain its price or is backed by precious metals and other commodities. To date, there have been stablecoins backed by fiat currencies in reserve, gold, and even cryptocurrency itself. Although some have failed and lost their desired peg, recent iterations have proven quite successful so far in their stability.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Value opportunity: Digital money</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The digital money industry is booming, driven in recent years especially by the Asia-Pacific region. In 2017, the revenue opportunities exceeded $1.9 trillion, trending double-digit percentage growth per year. While cryptocurrencies have many desirable properties for digital payments, such as low transaction fees, asset transfer simplicity, and auditability, the price volatility of mainstream cryptocurrencies is currently untenable for production use cases. Wild price swings are not good for buying groceries and paying rent. Simple tasks become unreasonably complex, as accounting loses its stability on a multitude of scales.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For example, cross-border payments are easy to facilitate with cryptocurrencies but their value fluctuation makes the process unreasonably complicated. If a farmer in an emerging economy wishes to send their family cryptocurrency, they must account for price fluctuations that may devalue the asset at a double-digit percentage before it can be liquidated for a local currency. Stablecoins have the opportunity to reap the benefits of cryptocurrencies while mitigating price volatility to acceptable levels.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Value opportunity: Open platforms</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Smart contracting platforms have the potential to solve problems “once and for all,” in the same vein as cloud service providers touting infrastructural block storage (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob) and computing power (Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure Compute). Due to their open nature, smart contracts may easily extend to the application layer and offer turnkey solutions to digital money, trade financing, supply chain management, and sharing economies.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Smart contracts can run at cost without intermediaries carving out high margins, a paradigm similar to well-run public utilities. However, the dominant way to pay for smart contract-based goods and services has been with volatile cryptocurrencies, adding currency risk to businesses that operate on more stable national currencies such as dollars, yuan, or euros. Alternatively, businesses may choose to purchase exact amounts of volatile cryptocurrencies as necessary, minimizing currency exposure but incurring new transaction fees with each subsequent transaction.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With the rise of stablecoins, businesses incur smaller currency risks and transaction fees. Due to a guarantee on the price of the asset being processed, there is minimal volatility risk and users and businesses alike can benefit from this stability. This can, in turn, drive adoption for smart contract systems due to reduced risk and improved ease of use. Businesses feel safer due to the benefits of automation and lower transaction costs, and users feel safer in knowing their personal assets won’t be devalued.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Stablecoin history</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Stablecoins aren’t a new revelation in the cryptocurrency space, as attempts at their implementations have been in motion since 2014. The first two attempts at creating stablecoins came from both BitUSD of BitShares, and NuBits—both of which were crypto collateralized iterations. Although both failed due to collateralization instability, they paved the way for new iterations that learned from their mistakes as well as strengthened the case for a price-stable asset represented as a cryptocurrency.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The first implementation of a reserved back stablecoin came in late 2014 from Tether, which was initially built on Bitcoin through the Omni layer. Although Tether offered the creation and redemption process typically associated with reserve backed stablecoins, its lack of transparency paved the way for transparent reserve backed stablecoins such as CENTRE’s USDC and Gemini’s GUSD.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are, in fact, three types of stablecoin implementations: reserve backed, crypto collateralized, and algorithmic, each with its own associated risks and tradeoffs. While reserve backed implementations provide transparency and absolute stability from natural arbitrage opportunities, there is added counterparty risk from the centralized controller. Crypto collateralized implementations forego counterparty risk at the expense of the volatility from their underlying collateral. Algorithmic stablecoins are dependent on incentive mechanisms and speculation, and haven’t had a proven implementation yet. However, all three are interesting in their approaches and allow users to gauge their comfort in using their choice of asset.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Stablecoin implementation types</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Reserve backed</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A reserve backed stablecoin is one that is typically issued by a central provider and is backed 1:1 to a fiat currency by means of both a tokenization and redemption process. To generate new tokens, customers send collateral to the provider, and the provider then mints or creates new tokens. The provider typically has the underlying collateral under custody with regular attestation reports, and “burns” or removes the tokens from circulation once they are redeemed.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Recent examples of reserve backed stablecoins include Gemini’s GUSD, CENTRE’s USDC, and Paxos’ PAX. Legacy reserve backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) has suffered much scrutiny due to the provider’s lack of regular auditing of the underlying collateral. However, the latest class of reserve backed stablecoins have been consistently providing audit reports from reputable firms.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Reserve backed stablecoins typically retain their peg from arbitrage cycles. For example, if Gemini’s GUSD is trading under $1, arbitrageurs are incentivized to buy the asset until it stabilizes and redeem the tokens for the underlying collateral, thereby making a profit. If the asset is trading over $1, arbitrageurs are incentivized to send collateral to Gemini in order to generate new tokens and sell them for the higher rate.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Typically in these systems, there’s an increased counterparty risk due to the ability of the central provider to freeze assets at any time. This issue came up recently with <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/winklevoss-crypto-gemini-gusd-stablecoin-redemption\">Gemini customers having redemption issues</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Crypto collateralized</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A crypto collateralized stablecoin is one that has cryptocurrency as its underlying collateral and uses price feeds associated with the collateral as a means of keeping the stablecoin at one dollar. In the case of crypto collateralized stablecoins, plenty of projects have made the attempt at stabilizing a system, but none have succeeded as much as MakerDAO.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Originally launched in 2017, DAI, the crypto collateralized stablecoin from the MakerDAO project, has remained relatively stable with continued development interest. Currently, DAI is collateralized by Ether (ETH), the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, and the project plans on utilizing other assets for collateral in the future. Users wishing to obtain DAI must first lock ETH in a “CDP,” or collateralized debt position. Due to the high volatility of ETH, DAI is typically overcollateralized at rates well over 100%.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If an individual’s CDP is ever close to being insolvent, the system triggers the sale of the user’s underlying collateral. If the system ever becomes insolvent due to a market crash in the price of the underlying collateral, Maker or “MKR,” the other token in the MakerDAO system, acts as a buyer of last resort where new MKR tokens are minted, effectively diluting current holders, and sold on the open market as a means of stabilizing the system.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>MKR holders are responsible for voting on resolutions and regulating the entire system through MakerDAO’s governance mechanisms. A fee in MKR is also paid to open CDPs to acquire DAI, effectively reducing the supply as more are opened.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Currently, the key centralized aspect with the most risk in MakerDAO’s system is its oracles that generate price feeds for the underlying collateral. Other centralized actors include “keepers,” or automated market makers that keep DAI around its target price. Considering limited arbitrage opportunities on a redemption process such as DAIs, external mechanisms such as these must be consulted to maintain stability.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Algorithmic</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The last major implementation of stablecoins is based on algorithms that trigger supply inflation and deflation in relation to the stablecoin’s target price. Algorithmic stablecoins aren’t backed by collateral, but rather have speculators involved with associated secondary and tertiary assets to keep the system balanced.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Algorithmic stablecoins are typically reliant on an elastic supply scheme building on Robert Sam’s Seigniorage Shares, where a base stable-asset is produced, but secondary and even tertiary assets generated and redeemed to ensure system stability. Seigniorage generally involves profiting from the creation of currency; the difference in the cost of the production of money and the money itself. In an algorithmic system, speculation on the secondary and tertiary assets to keep an algorithmic system stable is designed to yield a profit. One recent example of an attempt at creating such a system was Basis, a project seeking to build an algorithmic model that recently refunded investors.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Basis model included three tokens: a stablecoin to retain its peg at one dollar, and “bonds” and “shares” that act as the secondary and tertiary assets. Bonds are created by the system during periods of price decline under the desired peg and are purchased using the stablecoin to deflate its supply and increase its price. The bonds are immediately redeemed once the price reaches above its target of $1. Shares act as a hedge on a healthy system, as shareholders are granted newly minted stablecoins if all bonds have been redeemed and the stablecoin continues to trade above $1. The inflation mechanism of the stablecoin is meant to drive the price down, as shareholders are granted tokens from it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To date, no algorithmic stablecoin has launched successfully. The next attempt at an algorithmic stablecoin launch will likely come from Carbon, and their CUSD stablecoin. At the moment, Carbon is fully collateralized by U.S. dollars held in bank accounts, but they plan on eventually transitioning to an alternative system.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>A plethora of implementations</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There is no shortage of projects wishing to issue stablecoins, as it has become quite a hot topic in recent times. To date, there are more than a dozen launched stablecoin projects with more continually being developed to serve different purposes. Most of them have been pegged to the U.S. dollar, but there are a few examples being collateralized by other fiat currencies and commodities. The most notable of which is Digix—which is backed by gold held in a custodial vault. Being able to leverage cost savings internally to an existing ecosystem is one of the primary use cases for institutions and enterprise companies to partner with or create their own stablecoin.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Last year, in particular, saw a dramatic rise in the number of reserved backed stablecoins that launched. Businesses such as Paxos, Gemini, and Circle saw the benefits of launching these assets and have since been building lofty ecosystems around their respective assets. They have also set the standard in regular auditing, providing attestation reports for each asset on a regular basis. This further lowers the risk profile of these assets while providing a safety mechanism to encourage originally skeptic outsiders to finally enter and interface with these technologies.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Volatility mitigation in production</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In order to reap the benefits of stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi) services are beginning to accept stablecoins as a means of interfacing with services. DeFi services are those that provide traditional financial services while ensuring transactions are protected, peer to peer, and that users retain custody of their assets at all times. Examples of these services include exchanges, automated asset management funds, and debt platforms.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One example of such a service is <a href=\"https://dharma.io/\">Dharma </a>—a suite of decentralized lending products. Dharma’s main product involves peer-to-peer lending where users can collateralize their cryptocurrencies in exchange for Ethereum or USDC—a stablecoin. This would allow risk to be averted, as the recipient would be able to avoid market volatility upon receiving a stablecoin. Even <a href=\"https://blockfi.com/\">BlockFi</a>, a competitor to Dharma, recently announced the integration of GUSD on their platform to help users avoid volatility.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Decentralized exchanges have also taken note of stablecoins and have continually added them as an available asset for trading. For example, <a href=\"https://blog.ethfinex.com/announcing-dai-integration-da1484ed86f/\">Ethfinex</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/ddex/ddex-makerdao-an-intro-to-decentralized-leveraged-trading-f76995fd9239\">DDex</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.kyber.network/kyber-network-lists-its-first-stablecoin-20fb6ba35d6\">Kyber Network</a> have all listed DAI on their exchanges in order to better assist new traders and those who need to exchange assets and avoid risk after liquidation. Even seasoned traders can now use DAI in order to hedge risk in short-term market fluctuations and benefit from its stability.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are a number of additional projects in the process of launching this year, including MelonPort, an asset management protocol, and Origin, a marketplace generation protocol that will also accept stablecoins as a way to mitigate volatility risk. The increase in stablecoin adoption is a positive signaling mechanism that is demonstrating a natural fit. As more decentralized applications and protocols continue to be developed, stablecoins will naturally serve as a transactional asset to greatly benefit end users.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Mass proliferation, or “One to Rule Them All”</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The recent announcement of the <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/news/digital-coin-payments\">JPM Coin</a>, a stablecoin by J.P. Morgan (which clearly demonstrates an institutional interest in the space), is going to usher in a wave of stablecoins in the next few years. These assets will range from other sovereign-backed fiat currencies such as the Yuan, Yen, and Euro, to other traditional commodities such as precious metals and rare earth minerals. However, their implementations will definitely take note of current iterations that provide a regular price peg free from value fluctuation (if a fiat currency), the least amount of risk for users.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The reasoning is that in the short to medium term, stablecoins provide an entrance toward a new financial system. Through this stable onramp into blockchain systems, users need not worry about market volatility when thinking about traditional payments, nor do they need to worry about open platform access being rescinded due to a market downturn. They provide predictability in price and provide a way to sideline funds during market swings without having to pay additional fees moving back into fiat.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is unlikely in the long term that there will be as many stablecoins as are currently available and being developed. While there won’t be a single controlling stablecoin due to the myriad of assets they could be pegged to, there will be a basket that commands a majority of the trading volume. Even with all of its historical issues, Tether still commands a vast majority of trading volume relative to other stablecoins simply because of its social relativity and continued redemption and minting arbitrage opportunities. Competition will drive pricing down and force the technology to grow quickly, but will also result in low or negative margins for the firms producing these but not operating at efficient enough scale.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The other inherent risk is to consider if and when cryptocurrencies reach a sufficiently high market capitalization and trading interest. Once enough volume reaches traditional medium of exchange (MoE) cryptocurrencies, prices may begin to plateau and stabilize due to a lack of illiquidity. If Bitcoin were to reach over a sufficient amount of trading volume, having a daily price fluctuation of 10%+ would be highly unlikely, lessening the value proposition of stablecoins. However, stablecoins for the foreseeable future will continue to provide a key stability mechanism by way of the policy and monetary controls we are starting to see implemented in some popular stablecoins today.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Allowing stablecoins to have monetary controls in place allows not just users but regulators and institutional entities to have a comfortable experience with a traditionally volatile asset class. Enterprises didn’t jump right into cloud computing, and to this day most still have at least some of their processes run locally—this will most likely be the same case for stablecoins and their adoption. Facebook has recently been <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-21/facebook-is-said-to-develop-stablecoin-for-whatsapp-transfers\">noted to be working on</a> a stablecoin with their WhatsApp messenger and have been testing it in India. This allows them to govern the monetary policy inside of their apps and build pathways into and out of their ecosystems. Not only does this allow them to save on transaction fees associated with more traditional systems, but it also allows them to guarantee stability in their walled gardens while using cryptocurrency. Facebook being an already digitally native company allows them to test the cost savings aspects while also complying with various regulatory requirements for their users across geographic lines.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As the stablecoin ecosystem continues to grow between enterprise players and existing blockchain ecosystem players such as Gemini and Coinbase, users will continue to have the freedom and flexibility to transition between fiat and crypto seamlessly, and more importantly, be granted the stability needed to avoid cryptocurrency’s current volatility crisis.</p>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/stablecoins-solving-the-cryptocurrency-volatility-crisis\\'>Stablecoins: Solving the cryptocurrency volatility crisis.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/-W4CZU2cC8Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}], 'summary': '<p><img src=\\'https://d3ucjech6zwjp8.cloudfront.net/600x450/tree-stump-2433166_1920_crop-4d463fffe27b3f4d02be8cc19609d71e.jpg\\'/></p><p><em>Resolving the volatility problem will unlock the groundwork needed for blockchain-based global payment systems.</em></p><p>For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, the long game of blockchain ecosystems is to create open platforms controlled by no single authority, inviting open participation from anyone.

Users of these systems will be able to transact seamlessly with peers at a far cheaper rate and with a dramatic increase of security due to the nature of these cryptographic systems. In the long term, solving this problem will vastly reduce the barrier to entry for use of smart contract-based services on public, consortium, and private blockchains—truly unlocking the automation value these technologies have to offer.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A cryptocurrency-based contender that has appeared in order to solve this crisis is called a stablecoin. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that is pegged by various means to a traditional fiat currency to maintain its price or is backed by precious metals and other commodities. To date, there have been stablecoins backed by fiat currencies in reserve, gold, and even cryptocurrency itself. Although some have failed and lost their desired peg, recent iterations have proven quite successful so far in their stability.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Value opportunity: Digital money</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The digital money industry is booming, driven in recent years especially by the Asia-Pacific region. In 2017, the revenue opportunities exceeded $1.9 trillion, trending double-digit percentage growth per year. While cryptocurrencies have many desirable properties for digital payments, such as low transaction fees, asset transfer simplicity, and auditability, the price volatility of mainstream cryptocurrencies is currently untenable for production use cases. Wild price swings are not good for buying groceries and paying rent. Simple tasks become unreasonably complex, as accounting loses its stability on a multitude of scales.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For example, cross-border payments are easy to facilitate with cryptocurrencies but their value fluctuation makes the process unreasonably complicated. If a farmer in an emerging economy wishes to send their family cryptocurrency, they must account for price fluctuations that may devalue the asset at a double-digit percentage before it can be liquidated for a local currency. Stablecoins have the opportunity to reap the benefits of cryptocurrencies while mitigating price volatility to acceptable levels.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Value opportunity: Open platforms</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Smart contracting platforms have the potential to solve problems “once and for all,” in the same vein as cloud service providers touting infrastructural block storage (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob) and computing power (Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure Compute). Due to their open nature, smart contracts may easily extend to the application layer and offer turnkey solutions to digital money, trade financing, supply chain management, and sharing economies.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Smart contracts can run at cost without intermediaries carving out high margins, a paradigm similar to well-run public utilities. However, the dominant way to pay for smart contract-based goods and services has been with volatile cryptocurrencies, adding currency risk to businesses that operate on more stable national currencies such as dollars, yuan, or euros. Alternatively, businesses may choose to purchase exact amounts of volatile cryptocurrencies as necessary, minimizing currency exposure but incurring new transaction fees with each subsequent transaction.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With the rise of stablecoins, businesses incur smaller currency risks and transaction fees. Due to a guarantee on the price of the asset being processed, there is minimal volatility risk and users and businesses alike can benefit from this stability. This can, in turn, drive adoption for smart contract systems due to reduced risk and improved ease of use. Businesses feel safer due to the benefits of automation and lower transaction costs, and users feel safer in knowing their personal assets won’t be devalued.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Stablecoin history</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Stablecoins aren’t a new revelation in the cryptocurrency space, as attempts at their implementations have been in motion since 2014. The first two attempts at creating stablecoins came from both BitUSD of BitShares, and NuBits—both of which were crypto collateralized iterations. Although both failed due to collateralization instability, they paved the way for new iterations that learned from their mistakes as well as strengthened the case for a price-stable asset represented as a cryptocurrency.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The first implementation of a reserved back stablecoin came in late 2014 from Tether, which was initially built on Bitcoin through the Omni layer. Although Tether offered the creation and redemption process typically associated with reserve backed stablecoins, its lack of transparency paved the way for transparent reserve backed stablecoins such as CENTRE’s USDC and Gemini’s GUSD.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are, in fact, three types of stablecoin implementations: reserve backed, crypto collateralized, and algorithmic, each with its own associated risks and tradeoffs. While reserve backed implementations provide transparency and absolute stability from natural arbitrage opportunities, there is added counterparty risk from the centralized controller. Crypto collateralized implementations forego counterparty risk at the expense of the volatility from their underlying collateral. Algorithmic stablecoins are dependent on incentive mechanisms and speculation, and haven’t had a proven implementation yet. However, all three are interesting in their approaches and allow users to gauge their comfort in using their choice of asset.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Stablecoin implementation types</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Reserve backed</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A reserve backed stablecoin is one that is typically issued by a central provider and is backed 1:1 to a fiat currency by means of both a tokenization and redemption process. To generate new tokens, customers send collateral to the provider, and the provider then mints or creates new tokens. The provider typically has the underlying collateral under custody with regular attestation reports, and “burns” or removes the tokens from circulation once they are redeemed.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Recent examples of reserve backed stablecoins include Gemini’s GUSD, CENTRE’s USDC, and Paxos’ PAX. Legacy reserve backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) has suffered much scrutiny due to the provider’s lack of regular auditing of the underlying collateral. However, the latest class of reserve backed stablecoins have been consistently providing audit reports from reputable firms.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Reserve backed stablecoins typically retain their peg from arbitrage cycles. For example, if Gemini’s GUSD is trading under $1, arbitrageurs are incentivized to buy the asset until it stabilizes and redeem the tokens for the underlying collateral, thereby making a profit. If the asset is trading over $1, arbitrageurs are incentivized to send collateral to Gemini in order to generate new tokens and sell them for the higher rate.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Typically in these systems, there’s an increased counterparty risk due to the ability of the central provider to freeze assets at any time. This issue came up recently with <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/winklevoss-crypto-gemini-gusd-stablecoin-redemption\">Gemini customers having redemption issues</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Crypto collateralized</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A crypto collateralized stablecoin is one that has cryptocurrency as its underlying collateral and uses price feeds associated with the collateral as a means of keeping the stablecoin at one dollar. In the case of crypto collateralized stablecoins, plenty of projects have made the attempt at stabilizing a system, but none have succeeded as much as MakerDAO.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Originally launched in 2017, DAI, the crypto collateralized stablecoin from the MakerDAO project, has remained relatively stable with continued development interest. Currently, DAI is collateralized by Ether (ETH), the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, and the project plans on utilizing other assets for collateral in the future. Users wishing to obtain DAI must first lock ETH in a “CDP,” or collateralized debt position. Due to the high volatility of ETH, DAI is typically overcollateralized at rates well over 100%.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If an individual’s CDP is ever close to being insolvent, the system triggers the sale of the user’s underlying collateral. If the system ever becomes insolvent due to a market crash in the price of the underlying collateral, Maker or “MKR,” the other token in the MakerDAO system, acts as a buyer of last resort where new MKR tokens are minted, effectively diluting current holders, and sold on the open market as a means of stabilizing the system.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>MKR holders are responsible for voting on resolutions and regulating the entire system through MakerDAO’s governance mechanisms. A fee in MKR is also paid to open CDPs to acquire DAI, effectively reducing the supply as more are opened.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Currently, the key centralized aspect with the most risk in MakerDAO’s system is its oracles that generate price feeds for the underlying collateral. Other centralized actors include “keepers,” or automated market makers that keep DAI around its target price. Considering limited arbitrage opportunities on a redemption process such as DAIs, external mechanisms such as these must be consulted to maintain stability.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Algorithmic</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The last major implementation of stablecoins is based on algorithms that trigger supply inflation and deflation in relation to the stablecoin’s target price. Algorithmic stablecoins aren’t backed by collateral, but rather have speculators involved with associated secondary and tertiary assets to keep the system balanced.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Algorithmic stablecoins are typically reliant on an elastic supply scheme building on Robert Sam’s Seigniorage Shares, where a base stable-asset is produced, but secondary and even tertiary assets generated and redeemed to ensure system stability. Seigniorage generally involves profiting from the creation of currency; the difference in the cost of the production of money and the money itself. In an algorithmic system, speculation on the secondary and tertiary assets to keep an algorithmic system stable is designed to yield a profit. One recent example of an attempt at creating such a system was Basis, a project seeking to build an algorithmic model that recently refunded investors.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Basis model included three tokens: a stablecoin to retain its peg at one dollar, and “bonds” and “shares” that act as the secondary and tertiary assets. Bonds are created by the system during periods of price decline under the desired peg and are purchased using the stablecoin to deflate its supply and increase its price. The bonds are immediately redeemed once the price reaches above its target of $1. Shares act as a hedge on a healthy system, as shareholders are granted newly minted stablecoins if all bonds have been redeemed and the stablecoin continues to trade above $1. The inflation mechanism of the stablecoin is meant to drive the price down, as shareholders are granted tokens from it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To date, no algorithmic stablecoin has launched successfully. The next attempt at an algorithmic stablecoin launch will likely come from Carbon, and their CUSD stablecoin. At the moment, Carbon is fully collateralized by U.S. dollars held in bank accounts, but they plan on eventually transitioning to an alternative system.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>A plethora of implementations</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There is no shortage of projects wishing to issue stablecoins, as it has become quite a hot topic in recent times. To date, there are more than a dozen launched stablecoin projects with more continually being developed to serve different purposes. Most of them have been pegged to the U.S. dollar, but there are a few examples being collateralized by other fiat currencies and commodities. The most notable of which is Digix—which is backed by gold held in a custodial vault. Being able to leverage cost savings internally to an existing ecosystem is one of the primary use cases for institutions and enterprise companies to partner with or create their own stablecoin.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Last year, in particular, saw a dramatic rise in the number of reserved backed stablecoins that launched. Businesses such as Paxos, Gemini, and Circle saw the benefits of launching these assets and have since been building lofty ecosystems around their respective assets. They have also set the standard in regular auditing, providing attestation reports for each asset on a regular basis. This further lowers the risk profile of these assets while providing a safety mechanism to encourage originally skeptic outsiders to finally enter and interface with these technologies.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Volatility mitigation in production</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In order to reap the benefits of stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi) services are beginning to accept stablecoins as a means of interfacing with services. DeFi services are those that provide traditional financial services while ensuring transactions are protected, peer to peer, and that users retain custody of their assets at all times. Examples of these services include exchanges, automated asset management funds, and debt platforms.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One example of such a service is <a href=\"https://dharma.io/\">Dharma </a>—a suite of decentralized lending products. Dharma’s main product involves peer-to-peer lending where users can collateralize their cryptocurrencies in exchange for Ethereum or USDC—a stablecoin. This would allow risk to be averted, as the recipient would be able to avoid market volatility upon receiving a stablecoin. Even <a href=\"https://blockfi.com/\">BlockFi</a>, a competitor to Dharma, recently announced the integration of GUSD on their platform to help users avoid volatility.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Decentralized exchanges have also taken note of stablecoins and have continually added them as an available asset for trading. For example, <a href=\"https://blog.ethfinex.com/announcing-dai-integration-da1484ed86f/\">Ethfinex</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/ddex/ddex-makerdao-an-intro-to-decentralized-leveraged-trading-f76995fd9239\">DDex</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.kyber.network/kyber-network-lists-its-first-stablecoin-20fb6ba35d6\">Kyber Network</a> have all listed DAI on their exchanges in order to better assist new traders and those who need to exchange assets and avoid risk after liquidation. Even seasoned traders can now use DAI in order to hedge risk in short-term market fluctuations and benefit from its stability.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are a number of additional projects in the process of launching this year, including MelonPort, an asset management protocol, and Origin, a marketplace generation protocol that will also accept stablecoins as a way to mitigate volatility risk. The increase in stablecoin adoption is a positive signaling mechanism that is demonstrating a natural fit. As more decentralized applications and protocols continue to be developed, stablecoins will naturally serve as a transactional asset to greatly benefit end users.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Mass proliferation, or “One to Rule Them All”</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The recent announcement of the <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/news/digital-coin-payments\">JPM Coin</a>, a stablecoin by J.P. Morgan (which clearly demonstrates an institutional interest in the space), is going to usher in a wave of stablecoins in the next few years. These assets will range from other sovereign-backed fiat currencies such as the Yuan, Yen, and Euro, to other traditional commodities such as precious metals and rare earth minerals. However, their implementations will definitely take note of current iterations that provide a regular price peg free from value fluctuation (if a fiat currency), the least amount of risk for users.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The reasoning is that in the short to medium term, stablecoins provide an entrance toward a new financial system. Through this stable onramp into blockchain systems, users need not worry about market volatility when thinking about traditional payments, nor do they need to worry about open platform access being rescinded due to a market downturn. They provide predictability in price and provide a way to sideline funds during market swings without having to pay additional fees moving back into fiat.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is unlikely in the long term that there will be as many stablecoins as are currently available and being developed. While there won’t be a single controlling stablecoin due to the myriad of assets they could be pegged to, there will be a basket that commands a majority of the trading volume. Even with all of its historical issues, Tether still commands a vast majority of trading volume relative to other stablecoins simply because of its social relativity and continued redemption and minting arbitrage opportunities. Competition will drive pricing down and force the technology to grow quickly, but will also result in low or negative margins for the firms producing these but not operating at efficient enough scale.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The other inherent risk is to consider if and when cryptocurrencies reach a sufficiently high market capitalization and trading interest. Once enough volume reaches traditional medium of exchange (MoE) cryptocurrencies, prices may begin to plateau and stabilize due to a lack of illiquidity. If Bitcoin were to reach over a sufficient amount of trading volume, having a daily price fluctuation of 10%+ would be highly unlikely, lessening the value proposition of stablecoins. However, stablecoins for the foreseeable future will continue to provide a key stability mechanism by way of the policy and monetary controls we are starting to see implemented in some popular stablecoins today.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Allowing stablecoins to have monetary controls in place allows not just users but regulators and institutional entities to have a comfortable experience with a traditionally volatile asset class. Enterprises didn’t jump right into cloud computing, and to this day most still have at least some of their processes run locally—this will most likely be the same case for stablecoins and their adoption. Facebook has recently been <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-21/facebook-is-said-to-develop-stablecoin-for-whatsapp-transfers\">noted to be working on</a> a stablecoin with their WhatsApp messenger and have been testing it in India. This allows them to govern the monetary policy inside of their apps and build pathways into and out of their ecosystems. Not only does this allow them to save on transaction fees associated with more traditional systems, but it also allows them to guarantee stability in their walled gardens while using cryptocurrency. Facebook being an already digitally native company allows them to test the cost savings aspects while also complying with various regulatory requirements for their users across geographic lines.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As the stablecoin ecosystem continues to grow between enterprise players and existing blockchain ecosystem players such as Gemini and Coinbase, users will continue to have the freedom and flexibility to transition between fiat and crypto seamlessly, and more importantly, be granted the stability needed to avoid cryptocurrency’s current volatility crisis.</p>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/stablecoins-solving-the-cryptocurrency-volatility-crisis\\'>Stablecoins: Solving the cryptocurrency volatility crisis.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/-W4CZU2cC8Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>', 'links': [{'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/-W4CZU2cC8Y/stablecoins-solving-the-cryptocurrency-volatility-crisis', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Wayne Chang, Gregory Rocco, Jacob Blish'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Wayne Chang, Gregory Rocco, Jacob Blish'}, 'author': 'Wayne Chang, Gregory Rocco, Jacob Blish', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/stablecoins-solving-the-cryptocurrency-volatility-crisis'}, {'title': 'Four short links: 25 April 2019', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Four short links: 25 April 2019'}, 'updated': '2019-04-25T10:50:00Z', 'updated_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=4, tm_mday=25, tm_hour=10, tm_min=50, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=115, tm_isdst=0), 'id': 'tag:www.oreilly.com,2019-04-25:/ideas/four-short-links-25-april-2019', 'guidislink': True, 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/_hcDgO7JMhU/four-short-links-25-april-2019', 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': '<p><em>Values Risk, Brain Interface, Hacking Scooters, and Behavioral Change</em></p><ol>\\r\\n<li>\\r\\n<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1517413/000119312519111675/d702138ds1.htm\">Fastly S-1</a> (SEC) -- <i>Our dedication to our values may negatively influence our financial results.

The tools we need to create Safe ML have been under development among cryptographers for the past 30 years, well before modern machine learning became practical.

I talked about their skills and common starting points.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>An interesting thing happened: the data scientists started pushing back, arguing that they are, in fact, as skilled as data engineers at data engineering. That was interesting because the data engineers didn’t push back saying they’re data scientists.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So, I’ve spent the past few months gathering data and observing the behaviors of data scientists in their natural habitat. This post will offer more information about why a data scientist is not a data engineer.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Why does this even matter?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Some people complained that this data scientist versus data engineer is a mere focus on titles. “Titles shouldn’t hold people back from learning or doing new things,” they argued. I agree; learn as much as you can. Just know that your learning may only scratch the surface of what’s necessary to put something in production. Otherwise, this leads to failure with big data projects.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It’s also feeding into the management level at companies. They’re hiring data scientists <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2017/03/what-happens-when-you-hire-a-data-scientist-without-a-data-engineer/\">expecting them</a> to be data engineers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I’ve heard this same story from a number of companies. They all play out the same: a company decides that data science is the way to get VC money, tons of ROI, mad street cred in their business circle, or some other reasons. This decision happens at C-level or VP-level. Let’s call this C-level person Alice.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The company goes on an exhaustive search to find the best data scientist ever. Let’s call this data scientist Bob.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It’s Bob’s first day. Alice comes up to Bob and excitedly tells him about all the projects she has in mind.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“That’s great. Where are these data pipelines and where is your Spark cluster?” Bob asks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Alice responds, “That’s what we’re expecting you to do. We hired you to do data science.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“I don’t know how to do any of that,” says Bob.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Alice looks at him quizzically, “But you’re a data scientist. Right? This is what you do.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“No, I use the data pipelines and data products that are already created.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Alice goes back to her office to figure out what happened. She stares at overly simplistic diagrams like the one shown in Figure 1 and can’t figure out why Bob can’t do the simple big data tasks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6KGiJ\"><img alt=\"venn diagram with data scientists and data engineers\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure1-42ac4b8503ed9b17c941d48f6c81f147.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>Overly simplistic venn diagram with data scientists and data engineers.

Later on, we’ll talk about the data scientists themselves.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Let’s face it. Data engineering is not in the limelight. It isn’t being proclaimed as the best job of the 21st century. It isn’t getting all of the media buzz. Conferences aren’t telling CxOs about the virtues of data engineering. If you only look at the cursory message, it’s all about data science and hiring data scientists.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This is starting to change. We have conferences on data engineering. There is a gradual recognition of the need for data engineering. I’m hoping pieces like this one shed light on this necessity. I’m hoping my body of work will educate organizations on this critical need.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Recognition and appreciation</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Even when organizations have data science and data engineering teams, there is still a lack of appreciation for the work that went into the data engineering side.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You even see this lack of credit during conference talks. The data scientist is talking about what they’ve created. I can see the extensive data engineering that went into their model, but it’s never called out during the talk. I don’t expect the talk to cover it in detail, but it would be nice to acknowledge the work that went into enabling their creation. Management and beginners to data science perceive that everything was possible with the data scientist’s skill set.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>How to get appreciation</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Lately, I’ve been getting questions from data engineers on how to get into their company’s limelight. They’re feeling that when a data scientist goes to show their latest creation, they’re either taking all of the credit or they’re given all of the credit by the management. Their basic question is: “How can I get the data scientists to stop taking credit for something that was both of our work?”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That’s a valid question from what I’m seeing at companies. Management doesn’t realize (and it isn’t socialized) the data engineering work that goes into all things data science. If you’re reading this and you’re thinking:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>My data scientists are data engineers</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>My data scientists are creating really complicated data pipelines</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Jesse must not know what he’s talking about</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>...you probably have a data engineer in the background who isn’t getting any limelight.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Similar to when <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2017/03/what-happens-when-you-hire-a-data-scientist-without-a-data-engineer/\">data scientists quit</a> without a data engineer, data engineers who don’t get recognition and appreciation will quit. Don’t kid yourself; there’s an equally hot job market for qualified data engineers as there is for data scientists.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Data science only happens with a little help from our friends</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6rJia\"><img alt=\"myth of Atlas\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure2-7dadc453228ac1fdfe14ee11d4e43323.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 2. </span>Even the Italians knew the importance of data engineers in the 1400s.

He was punished by having to hold up the world/sky/celestial spheres. The earth only exists in its current form because Atlas holds it up.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In a similar way, data engineers hold up the world of data science. There isn’t much thought or credit that goes to the person holding up the world, but there should be. All levels of an organization should understand that data science is only enabled through the work of the data engineering team.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Data scientists aren’t data engineers</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That brings us to why data scientists think they’re data engineers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A few caveats to head off comments before we continue:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>I think data scientists are really smart, and I enjoy working with them.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>I’m wondering if this intelligence causes a higher IQ Dunning-Kruger effect.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Some of the best data engineers I’ve known have been data scientists, though this number is very small.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>There is a consistent overestimation when assessing our own skills.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-32ri8\"><img alt=\"Empirical diagram of data scientists’ perceived data engineering skills versus their actual skills\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure3-fc72719498859c6a50ac911952e1d920.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 3. </span>Empirical diagram of data scientists’ perceived data engineering skills versus their actual skills.

It’s an interesting social experiment in biases. Most data scientists over assessed their own data engineering abilities. Some gave an accurate assessment, but none of them gave a lower assessment than their actual ability.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are two things missing from this diagram:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>What is the skill level of data engineers?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What is the skill level needed for a moderately complicated data pipeline?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-q4iAV\"><img alt=\"Empirical diagram of data scientists’ and data engineers’ data engineering skills\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure4-489301cb2af38ca5cc96e4958ecf6405.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 4. </span>Empirical diagram of data scientists’ and data engineers’ data engineering skills with the skill needed to create a moderately complicated data pipeline. Illustration by Jesse Anderson, used with permission.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>From this figure, you can start to see the differences in the required data engineering abilities. In fact, I’m being more generous with the number of data scientists able to create a moderately complicated data pipeline. The reality may be that data scientists should be half of what the diagram shows.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Overall, it shows the approximate portions of the two groups who can and cannot create data pipelines. Yes, some data engineers can’t create a moderately complicated data pipeline. Conversely, most data scientists can’t, either. This comes back to the business issue at hand: organizations are giving their big data projects to individuals who lack the ability to succeed with the project.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<aside data-type=\"sidebar\" id=\"whats-a-moderately-complicated-data-pipeline-4LS2P\">\\r\\n<h3>What’s a moderately complicated data pipeline?</h3>\\r\\n<p>A moderately complicated data pipeline is one step above the bare minimum to create a <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2018/08/what-is-a-data-pipeline/\">data pipeline</a>. An example of a bare minimum is processing text files stored in HDFS/S3 with Spark. An example of a moderately complicated data pipeline is to start optimizing your storage with a correctly used NoSQL database that uses a binary format like Avro.</p>\\r\\n<p>I think data scientists are thinking that their simple data pipeline is what data engineering is. The reality is that they’re talking about hello-world levels and a far more complicated data pipeline is required. In the past, a data engineer performed the really difficult data engineering behind the scenes and the data scientists didn’t have to deal with it.</p>\\r\\n</aside>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You might think, “Good, so 20% of my data scientists can actually do this. I don\\'t need a data engineer after all.” First, remember this chart is being charitable in showing data scientists’ abilities. Remember that moderately complicated is still a pretty low bar. I need to create another diagram to show how few data scientists can handle the next step up in complexity. This is where the percentage drops to 1% or less of data scientists.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Why aren’t data scientists data engineers?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Sometimes I prefer to see the reflected manifestations of problems. These are a few examples of the manisted problems that make data scientists lack the data engineering skill set.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>University and other courses</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Data science is the hot new course out there for universities and online courses. There are all sorts of offerings out there, but virtually all of them have the same problem: they either completely lack or have one data engineering class.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When I see a new university’s data science curriculum announced, I take a look at it. Sometimes, I’ll be asked for comments on a university’s proposed data science curriculum. I give them same feedback: “Are you expecting expert programmers? Because there isn’t any coverage of the programming or systems required to even consume a data pipeline that’s been created.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The course outlines generally focus on the statistics and math required. This reflects what companies and academics think data science should look like. The real world looks rather different. The poor students are left to fend for themselves for the rest of these non-trivial learnings.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We can take a step back and look at this academically by looking at course requirements for a master’s degree in distributed systems. Obviously, a data scientist doesn’t need this level of depth, but it helps show what’s missing and the big holes in a data scientist’s skill set. There are some major deficiencies.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Data engineering != Spark</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A common misconception from data scientists—and management—is that data engineering is just writing some Spark code to process a file. Spark is a good solution for <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2019/01/the-three-components-of-a-big-data-data-pipeline/\">batch compute</a>, but it isn’t the only technology you’ll need. A big data solution will require <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/learning/on-complexity-in-big-data\">10-30 different technologies</a> all working together.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This sort of thinking lies at the heart of big data failures. Management thinks they have a new silver bullet to kill all of their big data problems. The reality is far more complicated than that.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When I mentor an organization on big data, I check for this misconception at all layers of the organization. If it does exist, I make sure I talk about all of the technologies they’ll need. This removes the misconception that there’s an easy button in big data and there’s a single technology to solve all of it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Where is the code from?</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Sometimes data scientists will tell me how easy data engineering is. I’ll get them to tell me how and why they think that. “I can get all the code I need from StackOverflow or Reddit. If I need to create something from scratch, I can copy someone’s design in a conference talk or a whitepaper.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To the non-engineer, this might seem OK. To the engineer, this starts major alarm bells. The legal issues aside, this isn’t engineering. There are very few cookie-cutter problems in big data. Everything after “hello world” has more complexity that needs a data engineer because there isn\\'t a cookie-cutter approach to dealing with it. Getting your design copied from a white paper could lead to a <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2017/10/on-cheating-with-big-data/\">poor performing design or worse</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I’ve dealt with a few data science teams who’ve tried this monkey-see-monkey-do approach. It doesn’t work well. This is due to big data’s <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/learning/on-complexity-in-big-data\">spike in complexity</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2017/07/this-is-useless-without-use-cases/\">extreme focus on use cases</a>. The data science team will often drop the project as it exceeds their data engineering abilities.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Put simply, there\\'s a big difference between “I can copy code from stackoverflow” or “I can modify something that\\'s already been written” and “I can create this system from scratch.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Personally, I’m worried that data science teams are going to be these sources of massive technical debt that squelches big data productivity in organizations. By the time it’s found out, the technical debt will be so high it might be infeasible to correct it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>What’s the longest their code has been in production?</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A core difference for data scientists is their depth. This depth is shown in two ways. What’s the longest time their code been in production—or has it ever been in production? What is the longest, largest, or most complicated program they have ever written?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This isn’t about gamesmanship or who’s better; it’s showing if they know what happens when you put something in production and how to maintain code. Writing a 20-line program is comparatively easy. Writing 1,000 lines of code that’s maintainable and coherent is another situation all together. People who’ve never written more than 20 lines don’t understand the miles of difference in maintainability. All of their complaints about Java verbosity or why programming best practices need to be used come into focus with large software projects.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Moving fast and breaking things works well when evaluating and discovering data. It requires a different and more intense level when working with code that goes into production. It’s for reasons like these that most data scientist’s code gets rewritten before it goes into production.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>When they design a distributed system</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One way to know the difference between data scientists and data engineers is to see what happens when they write their own distributed systems. A data scientist will write one that is very math focused but performs terribly. A software engineer with a specialization in writing distributed systems will create one that performs well and is distributed (<a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2017/12/why-you-shouldnt-write-your-own-distributed-system/\">but seriously don’t write your own</a>). I’ll share a few stories of my interactions with organizations where data scientists created a distributed system.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A business unit that was made up of data scientists at my customer’s company created a distributed system. I was sent in to talk to them and get an understanding of why they created their own system and what it could do. They were doing (distributed) image processing.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I started out by asking them why they created their own distributed system. They responded that it wasn’t possible to distribute the algorithm. To validate their findings, they contracted another data scientist with a specialty in image processing. The data scientist contractor confirmed that it wasn’t possible to distribute the algorithm.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the two hours I spent with the team, it was clear that the algorithm could be distributed on a general-purpose compute engine, like Spark. It was also clear that the distributed system they wrote wouldn’t scale and had serious design flaws. By having another data scientist validate their findings instead of a qualified data engineer, they had another novice programmer validate their novice findings.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At another company run by mathematicians, they told me about the distributed system they wrote. It was written so that math problems could be run on other computers. A few things were clear after talking to them. They could have used a general-purpose compute engine and been better off. The way they were distributing and running jobs was inefficient. It was taking longer to do the RPC network traffic than it was to perform the calculation.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are commonalities to all of these stories and others I didn’t tell:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Data scientists focus on the math instead of the system. The system is there to run math instead of running math efficiently.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Data engineers know the tricks that aren’t math. We’re not trying to cancel out infinities.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>A data scientist asks, “how can I get a computer to do my math problems?” A data engineer asks, “how can I get a computer to do my math problems as fast and efficiently as possible?”</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>The organizations could have saved themselves time, money, and heartache by using a general-purpose engine instead of writing their own.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>What’s the difference?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You’ve made it this far and I hope I’ve convinced you: data scientists are not data engineers. But really, what difference does all of this make?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>The difference between a data scientist and a data engineer is the difference between an organization succeeding or failing in their big data project.</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Data science from an engineering perspective</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When I first started to work with data scientists, I was surprised at how little they begged, borrowed, and stole from the engineering side. On the engineering front, we have some well-established best practices that weren’t being used on the data science side. A few of these are:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Source control</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Continuous integration</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Project management frameworks like Agile or Scrum</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>IDEs</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Bug tracking</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Code reviews</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Commenting code</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You saw me offhandedly mention the technical debt I’ve seen in data science teams. Let me elaborate on why I’m so worried about this. When I start pushing on a data science team to use best practices, I get two answers: “we know and we’re going to implement that later” or “we don’t need these heavyweight engineering practices. We’re agile and nimble. These models won’t go into production yet.” The best practices never get implemented and that model goes straight into production. Each one of these issues leads to a compounding of technical debt.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Code quality</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Would you put your intern’s code into production? If you’re in management, go ask your VP of engineering if they’ll put a second-year computer science student’s code into production. You might get a vehement no. Or they might say after the code was reviewed by other members of the team.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Are you going to put your data scientist’s code into production? Part of the thrust of this article is that data scientists are often novices at programming—at best—and their code is going into production. Take a look back up at the best practices that data science teams aren’t doing. There are no checks and balances to keep amateur code from going into production.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Why did they get good?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I want to end this by addressing the people who are still thinking their data scientists are data engineers. Or those data scientists who are also qualified data engineers. I want to restate that you can see from the figure it is possible, just not probable.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If this is true, I’d like you to think about why this happened.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In my experience, this happens when the ratio of data scientists to data engineers is well out of alignment. This happens when the ratio is inverted and there are zero data engineers in the organization. There should be more like two to five data engineers per data scientist. This ratio is needed because more time goes into the data engineering side than the data science.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When teams lack the right ratio, they’re making poor use of their data scientists’ time. Data scientists tend to get stuck on the programming parts that data engineers are proficient in. I’ve seen too many data scientists spend days on something that would take a data engineer an hour. This incorrectly perceived and solved problem leads organizations to hire more data scientists instead of hiring the right people who make the process more efficient.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Other times, they’re misunderstanding what a <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2018/06/the-two-types-of-data-engineering/\">data engineer is</a>. Having unqualified or the wrong type of data engineer is just as bad. You need to make sure you’re getting qualified help. This leads to the fallacy that you don’t need a data engineer because the ones you’ve worked with aren’t competent.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I’m often asked by management how they should get their data scientists to be more technically proficient. I respond that this is more a question of should the data scientists become more technically proficient. This is important for several reasons:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>There’s a low point of diminishing returns for a data science team that isn’t very technical to begin with. They can study for months, but may never get much better.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>It assumes that a data scientist is a data engineer and that isn’t correct. It would be better to target the one or two individuals on the data science team with the innate abilities to get better.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Is there an ROI to this improvement? If the data science team gets better, what could it do better or different?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>It assumes the highest value is to improve the data science team. The better investment may be in improving the data engineering team and facilitating better communication and relations between the data science and data engineering teams.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>It assumes that the data scientists actually want to improve technically. I’ve found that data scientists consider data engineering a means to an end. By doing the data engineering work, they get to do the fun data science stuff.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>What should we do?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Given that a data scientist is not a data engineer, what should we do? First and foremost, we have to understand what data scientists and data engineers do. We have to realize this isn’t a focus on titles and limiting people based on that. This is about a fundamental difference in what each person is good at and their core strengths.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Having a data scientist do data engineering tasks is fraught with failure. Conversely, having a data engineer do data science is fraught with failure. If your organization is trying to do data science, you need both people. Each person fulfills a complementary and necessary role.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For larger organizations, you will start to see the need for people who split the difference between the data scientist and data engineer skill sets. I recommend the management team look at creating a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/data-engineers-vs-data-scientists\">machine learning engineer</a> title and hiring for it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Success with big data</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As you’ve seen here, the path to success with big data isn’t just technical—there are <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2018/11/creating-a-data-engineering-culture/\">critical management parts</a>. Misunderstanding the nature of data scientists and data engineers is just one of those. If you’re having trouble with your big data projects, don’t just look for technical reasons. The underlying issue may be a management or team failure.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As you’re doing a root cause analysis of why a big data project stalled or failed, don’t just look at or blame the technology. Also, don’t just take the data science team’s explanation because they may not have enough experience to know or understand why it failed. Instead, you’ll need to go deeper—and often more painfully—to look at the management or team failings that led to a project failure.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Failures like these form a repeating and continuous pattern. You can move to the newest technology, but you’re just fixing the systemic issues. Only by fixing the root issue can you start to be successful.</p>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/why-a-data-scientist-is-not-a-data-engineer\\'>Why a data scientist is not a data engineer.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/vRnLXKurjtg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}], 'summary': '<p><img src=\\'https://d3ucjech6zwjp8.cloudfront.net/600x450/6860026117_433297ffe1_o_crop-cd794b2963d63c21470daffac799396c.jpg\\'/></p><p><em>Or, why science and engineering are still different disciplines.</em></p><blockquote>\\r\\n<p>\"A scientist can discover a new star, but he cannot make one.

I talked about their skills and common starting points.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>An interesting thing happened: the data scientists started pushing back, arguing that they are, in fact, as skilled as data engineers at data engineering. That was interesting because the data engineers didn’t push back saying they’re data scientists.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So, I’ve spent the past few months gathering data and observing the behaviors of data scientists in their natural habitat. This post will offer more information about why a data scientist is not a data engineer.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Why does this even matter?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Some people complained that this data scientist versus data engineer is a mere focus on titles. “Titles shouldn’t hold people back from learning or doing new things,” they argued. I agree; learn as much as you can. Just know that your learning may only scratch the surface of what’s necessary to put something in production. Otherwise, this leads to failure with big data projects.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It’s also feeding into the management level at companies. They’re hiring data scientists <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2017/03/what-happens-when-you-hire-a-data-scientist-without-a-data-engineer/\">expecting them</a> to be data engineers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I’ve heard this same story from a number of companies. They all play out the same: a company decides that data science is the way to get VC money, tons of ROI, mad street cred in their business circle, or some other reasons. This decision happens at C-level or VP-level. Let’s call this C-level person Alice.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The company goes on an exhaustive search to find the best data scientist ever. Let’s call this data scientist Bob.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It’s Bob’s first day. Alice comes up to Bob and excitedly tells him about all the projects she has in mind.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“That’s great. Where are these data pipelines and where is your Spark cluster?” Bob asks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Alice responds, “That’s what we’re expecting you to do. We hired you to do data science.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“I don’t know how to do any of that,” says Bob.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Alice looks at him quizzically, “But you’re a data scientist. Right? This is what you do.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“No, I use the data pipelines and data products that are already created.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Alice goes back to her office to figure out what happened. She stares at overly simplistic diagrams like the one shown in Figure 1 and can’t figure out why Bob can’t do the simple big data tasks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6KGiJ\"><img alt=\"venn diagram with data scientists and data engineers\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure1-42ac4b8503ed9b17c941d48f6c81f147.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>Overly simplistic venn diagram with data scientists and data engineers.

Later on, we’ll talk about the data scientists themselves.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Let’s face it. Data engineering is not in the limelight. It isn’t being proclaimed as the best job of the 21st century. It isn’t getting all of the media buzz. Conferences aren’t telling CxOs about the virtues of data engineering. If you only look at the cursory message, it’s all about data science and hiring data scientists.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This is starting to change. We have conferences on data engineering. There is a gradual recognition of the need for data engineering. I’m hoping pieces like this one shed light on this necessity. I’m hoping my body of work will educate organizations on this critical need.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Recognition and appreciation</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Even when organizations have data science and data engineering teams, there is still a lack of appreciation for the work that went into the data engineering side.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You even see this lack of credit during conference talks. The data scientist is talking about what they’ve created. I can see the extensive data engineering that went into their model, but it’s never called out during the talk. I don’t expect the talk to cover it in detail, but it would be nice to acknowledge the work that went into enabling their creation. Management and beginners to data science perceive that everything was possible with the data scientist’s skill set.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>How to get appreciation</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Lately, I’ve been getting questions from data engineers on how to get into their company’s limelight. They’re feeling that when a data scientist goes to show their latest creation, they’re either taking all of the credit or they’re given all of the credit by the management. Their basic question is: “How can I get the data scientists to stop taking credit for something that was both of our work?”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That’s a valid question from what I’m seeing at companies. Management doesn’t realize (and it isn’t socialized) the data engineering work that goes into all things data science. If you’re reading this and you’re thinking:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>My data scientists are data engineers</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>My data scientists are creating really complicated data pipelines</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Jesse must not know what he’s talking about</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>...you probably have a data engineer in the background who isn’t getting any limelight.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Similar to when <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2017/03/what-happens-when-you-hire-a-data-scientist-without-a-data-engineer/\">data scientists quit</a> without a data engineer, data engineers who don’t get recognition and appreciation will quit. Don’t kid yourself; there’s an equally hot job market for qualified data engineers as there is for data scientists.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Data science only happens with a little help from our friends</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6rJia\"><img alt=\"myth of Atlas\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure2-7dadc453228ac1fdfe14ee11d4e43323.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 2. </span>Even the Italians knew the importance of data engineers in the 1400s.

He was punished by having to hold up the world/sky/celestial spheres. The earth only exists in its current form because Atlas holds it up.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In a similar way, data engineers hold up the world of data science. There isn’t much thought or credit that goes to the person holding up the world, but there should be. All levels of an organization should understand that data science is only enabled through the work of the data engineering team.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Data scientists aren’t data engineers</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That brings us to why data scientists think they’re data engineers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A few caveats to head off comments before we continue:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>I think data scientists are really smart, and I enjoy working with them.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>I’m wondering if this intelligence causes a higher IQ Dunning-Kruger effect.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Some of the best data engineers I’ve known have been data scientists, though this number is very small.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>There is a consistent overestimation when assessing our own skills.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-32ri8\"><img alt=\"Empirical diagram of data scientists’ perceived data engineering skills versus their actual skills\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure3-fc72719498859c6a50ac911952e1d920.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 3. </span>Empirical diagram of data scientists’ perceived data engineering skills versus their actual skills.

It’s an interesting social experiment in biases. Most data scientists over assessed their own data engineering abilities. Some gave an accurate assessment, but none of them gave a lower assessment than their actual ability.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are two things missing from this diagram:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>What is the skill level of data engineers?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What is the skill level needed for a moderately complicated data pipeline?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-q4iAV\"><img alt=\"Empirical diagram of data scientists’ and data engineers’ data engineering skills\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure4-489301cb2af38ca5cc96e4958ecf6405.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 4. </span>Empirical diagram of data scientists’ and data engineers’ data engineering skills with the skill needed to create a moderately complicated data pipeline. Illustration by Jesse Anderson, used with permission.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>From this figure, you can start to see the differences in the required data engineering abilities. In fact, I’m being more generous with the number of data scientists able to create a moderately complicated data pipeline. The reality may be that data scientists should be half of what the diagram shows.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Overall, it shows the approximate portions of the two groups who can and cannot create data pipelines. Yes, some data engineers can’t create a moderately complicated data pipeline. Conversely, most data scientists can’t, either. This comes back to the business issue at hand: organizations are giving their big data projects to individuals who lack the ability to succeed with the project.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<aside data-type=\"sidebar\" id=\"whats-a-moderately-complicated-data-pipeline-4LS2P\">\\r\\n<h3>What’s a moderately complicated data pipeline?</h3>\\r\\n<p>A moderately complicated data pipeline is one step above the bare minimum to create a <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2018/08/what-is-a-data-pipeline/\">data pipeline</a>. An example of a bare minimum is processing text files stored in HDFS/S3 with Spark. An example of a moderately complicated data pipeline is to start optimizing your storage with a correctly used NoSQL database that uses a binary format like Avro.</p>\\r\\n<p>I think data scientists are thinking that their simple data pipeline is what data engineering is. The reality is that they’re talking about hello-world levels and a far more complicated data pipeline is required. In the past, a data engineer performed the really difficult data engineering behind the scenes and the data scientists didn’t have to deal with it.</p>\\r\\n</aside>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You might think, “Good, so 20% of my data scientists can actually do this. I don\\'t need a data engineer after all.” First, remember this chart is being charitable in showing data scientists’ abilities. Remember that moderately complicated is still a pretty low bar. I need to create another diagram to show how few data scientists can handle the next step up in complexity. This is where the percentage drops to 1% or less of data scientists.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Why aren’t data scientists data engineers?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Sometimes I prefer to see the reflected manifestations of problems. These are a few examples of the manisted problems that make data scientists lack the data engineering skill set.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>University and other courses</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Data science is the hot new course out there for universities and online courses. There are all sorts of offerings out there, but virtually all of them have the same problem: they either completely lack or have one data engineering class.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When I see a new university’s data science curriculum announced, I take a look at it. Sometimes, I’ll be asked for comments on a university’s proposed data science curriculum. I give them same feedback: “Are you expecting expert programmers? Because there isn’t any coverage of the programming or systems required to even consume a data pipeline that’s been created.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The course outlines generally focus on the statistics and math required. This reflects what companies and academics think data science should look like. The real world looks rather different. The poor students are left to fend for themselves for the rest of these non-trivial learnings.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We can take a step back and look at this academically by looking at course requirements for a master’s degree in distributed systems. Obviously, a data scientist doesn’t need this level of depth, but it helps show what’s missing and the big holes in a data scientist’s skill set. There are some major deficiencies.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Data engineering != Spark</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A common misconception from data scientists—and management—is that data engineering is just writing some Spark code to process a file. Spark is a good solution for <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2019/01/the-three-components-of-a-big-data-data-pipeline/\">batch compute</a>, but it isn’t the only technology you’ll need. A big data solution will require <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/learning/on-complexity-in-big-data\">10-30 different technologies</a> all working together.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This sort of thinking lies at the heart of big data failures. Management thinks they have a new silver bullet to kill all of their big data problems. The reality is far more complicated than that.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When I mentor an organization on big data, I check for this misconception at all layers of the organization. If it does exist, I make sure I talk about all of the technologies they’ll need. This removes the misconception that there’s an easy button in big data and there’s a single technology to solve all of it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Where is the code from?</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Sometimes data scientists will tell me how easy data engineering is. I’ll get them to tell me how and why they think that. “I can get all the code I need from StackOverflow or Reddit. If I need to create something from scratch, I can copy someone’s design in a conference talk or a whitepaper.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To the non-engineer, this might seem OK. To the engineer, this starts major alarm bells. The legal issues aside, this isn’t engineering. There are very few cookie-cutter problems in big data. Everything after “hello world” has more complexity that needs a data engineer because there isn\\'t a cookie-cutter approach to dealing with it. Getting your design copied from a white paper could lead to a <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2017/10/on-cheating-with-big-data/\">poor performing design or worse</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I’ve dealt with a few data science teams who’ve tried this monkey-see-monkey-do approach. It doesn’t work well. This is due to big data’s <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/learning/on-complexity-in-big-data\">spike in complexity</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2017/07/this-is-useless-without-use-cases/\">extreme focus on use cases</a>. The data science team will often drop the project as it exceeds their data engineering abilities.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Put simply, there\\'s a big difference between “I can copy code from stackoverflow” or “I can modify something that\\'s already been written” and “I can create this system from scratch.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Personally, I’m worried that data science teams are going to be these sources of massive technical debt that squelches big data productivity in organizations. By the time it’s found out, the technical debt will be so high it might be infeasible to correct it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>What’s the longest their code has been in production?</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A core difference for data scientists is their depth. This depth is shown in two ways. What’s the longest time their code been in production—or has it ever been in production? What is the longest, largest, or most complicated program they have ever written?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This isn’t about gamesmanship or who’s better; it’s showing if they know what happens when you put something in production and how to maintain code. Writing a 20-line program is comparatively easy. Writing 1,000 lines of code that’s maintainable and coherent is another situation all together. People who’ve never written more than 20 lines don’t understand the miles of difference in maintainability. All of their complaints about Java verbosity or why programming best practices need to be used come into focus with large software projects.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Moving fast and breaking things works well when evaluating and discovering data. It requires a different and more intense level when working with code that goes into production. It’s for reasons like these that most data scientist’s code gets rewritten before it goes into production.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>When they design a distributed system</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One way to know the difference between data scientists and data engineers is to see what happens when they write their own distributed systems. A data scientist will write one that is very math focused but performs terribly. A software engineer with a specialization in writing distributed systems will create one that performs well and is distributed (<a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2017/12/why-you-shouldnt-write-your-own-distributed-system/\">but seriously don’t write your own</a>). I’ll share a few stories of my interactions with organizations where data scientists created a distributed system.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A business unit that was made up of data scientists at my customer’s company created a distributed system. I was sent in to talk to them and get an understanding of why they created their own system and what it could do. They were doing (distributed) image processing.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I started out by asking them why they created their own distributed system. They responded that it wasn’t possible to distribute the algorithm. To validate their findings, they contracted another data scientist with a specialty in image processing. The data scientist contractor confirmed that it wasn’t possible to distribute the algorithm.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the two hours I spent with the team, it was clear that the algorithm could be distributed on a general-purpose compute engine, like Spark. It was also clear that the distributed system they wrote wouldn’t scale and had serious design flaws. By having another data scientist validate their findings instead of a qualified data engineer, they had another novice programmer validate their novice findings.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At another company run by mathematicians, they told me about the distributed system they wrote. It was written so that math problems could be run on other computers. A few things were clear after talking to them. They could have used a general-purpose compute engine and been better off. The way they were distributing and running jobs was inefficient. It was taking longer to do the RPC network traffic than it was to perform the calculation.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are commonalities to all of these stories and others I didn’t tell:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Data scientists focus on the math instead of the system. The system is there to run math instead of running math efficiently.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Data engineers know the tricks that aren’t math. We’re not trying to cancel out infinities.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>A data scientist asks, “how can I get a computer to do my math problems?” A data engineer asks, “how can I get a computer to do my math problems as fast and efficiently as possible?”</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>The organizations could have saved themselves time, money, and heartache by using a general-purpose engine instead of writing their own.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>What’s the difference?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You’ve made it this far and I hope I’ve convinced you: data scientists are not data engineers. But really, what difference does all of this make?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>The difference between a data scientist and a data engineer is the difference between an organization succeeding or failing in their big data project.</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Data science from an engineering perspective</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When I first started to work with data scientists, I was surprised at how little they begged, borrowed, and stole from the engineering side. On the engineering front, we have some well-established best practices that weren’t being used on the data science side. A few of these are:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Source control</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Continuous integration</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Project management frameworks like Agile or Scrum</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>IDEs</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Bug tracking</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Code reviews</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Commenting code</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You saw me offhandedly mention the technical debt I’ve seen in data science teams. Let me elaborate on why I’m so worried about this. When I start pushing on a data science team to use best practices, I get two answers: “we know and we’re going to implement that later” or “we don’t need these heavyweight engineering practices. We’re agile and nimble. These models won’t go into production yet.” The best practices never get implemented and that model goes straight into production. Each one of these issues leads to a compounding of technical debt.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Code quality</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Would you put your intern’s code into production? If you’re in management, go ask your VP of engineering if they’ll put a second-year computer science student’s code into production. You might get a vehement no. Or they might say after the code was reviewed by other members of the team.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Are you going to put your data scientist’s code into production? Part of the thrust of this article is that data scientists are often novices at programming—at best—and their code is going into production. Take a look back up at the best practices that data science teams aren’t doing. There are no checks and balances to keep amateur code from going into production.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Why did they get good?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I want to end this by addressing the people who are still thinking their data scientists are data engineers. Or those data scientists who are also qualified data engineers. I want to restate that you can see from the figure it is possible, just not probable.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If this is true, I’d like you to think about why this happened.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In my experience, this happens when the ratio of data scientists to data engineers is well out of alignment. This happens when the ratio is inverted and there are zero data engineers in the organization. There should be more like two to five data engineers per data scientist. This ratio is needed because more time goes into the data engineering side than the data science.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When teams lack the right ratio, they’re making poor use of their data scientists’ time. Data scientists tend to get stuck on the programming parts that data engineers are proficient in. I’ve seen too many data scientists spend days on something that would take a data engineer an hour. This incorrectly perceived and solved problem leads organizations to hire more data scientists instead of hiring the right people who make the process more efficient.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Other times, they’re misunderstanding what a <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2018/06/the-two-types-of-data-engineering/\">data engineer is</a>. Having unqualified or the wrong type of data engineer is just as bad. You need to make sure you’re getting qualified help. This leads to the fallacy that you don’t need a data engineer because the ones you’ve worked with aren’t competent.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I’m often asked by management how they should get their data scientists to be more technically proficient. I respond that this is more a question of should the data scientists become more technically proficient. This is important for several reasons:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>There’s a low point of diminishing returns for a data science team that isn’t very technical to begin with. They can study for months, but may never get much better.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>It assumes that a data scientist is a data engineer and that isn’t correct. It would be better to target the one or two individuals on the data science team with the innate abilities to get better.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Is there an ROI to this improvement? If the data science team gets better, what could it do better or different?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>It assumes the highest value is to improve the data science team. The better investment may be in improving the data engineering team and facilitating better communication and relations between the data science and data engineering teams.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>It assumes that the data scientists actually want to improve technically. I’ve found that data scientists consider data engineering a means to an end. By doing the data engineering work, they get to do the fun data science stuff.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>What should we do?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Given that a data scientist is not a data engineer, what should we do? First and foremost, we have to understand what data scientists and data engineers do. We have to realize this isn’t a focus on titles and limiting people based on that. This is about a fundamental difference in what each person is good at and their core strengths.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Having a data scientist do data engineering tasks is fraught with failure. Conversely, having a data engineer do data science is fraught with failure. If your organization is trying to do data science, you need both people. Each person fulfills a complementary and necessary role.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For larger organizations, you will start to see the need for people who split the difference between the data scientist and data engineer skill sets. I recommend the management team look at creating a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/data-engineers-vs-data-scientists\">machine learning engineer</a> title and hiring for it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Success with big data</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As you’ve seen here, the path to success with big data isn’t just technical—there are <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2018/11/creating-a-data-engineering-culture/\">critical management parts</a>. Misunderstanding the nature of data scientists and data engineers is just one of those. If you’re having trouble with your big data projects, don’t just look for technical reasons. The underlying issue may be a management or team failure.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As you’re doing a root cause analysis of why a big data project stalled or failed, don’t just look at or blame the technology. Also, don’t just take the data science team’s explanation because they may not have enough experience to know or understand why it failed. Instead, you’ll need to go deeper—and often more painfully—to look at the management or team failings that led to a project failure.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Failures like these form a repeating and continuous pattern. You can move to the newest technology, but you’re just fixing the systemic issues. Only by fixing the root issue can you start to be successful.</p>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/why-a-data-scientist-is-not-a-data-engineer\\'>Why a data scientist is not a data engineer.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/vRnLXKurjtg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>', 'links': [{'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/vRnLXKurjtg/why-a-data-scientist-is-not-a-data-engineer', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Jesse Anderson'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Jesse Anderson'}, 'author': 'Jesse Anderson', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/why-a-data-scientist-is-not-a-data-engineer'}, {'title': 'Four short links: 8 April 2019', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Four short links: 8 April 2019'}, 'updated': '2019-04-08T12:10:00Z', 'updated_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=4, tm_mday=8, tm_hour=12, tm_min=10, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=98, tm_isdst=0), 'id': 'tag:www.oreilly.com,2019-04-08:/ideas/four-short-links-8-april-2019', 'guidislink': True, 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/-dO5qNzZZsk/four-short-links-8-april-2019', 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': '<p><em>Chinese Livestreaming, Tech and Teens, YouTube Professionalizing, and Inclusive Meetings</em></p><ol>\\r\\n<li>\\r\\n<a href=\"http://www.sixthtone.com/news/1003642/inside-the-dystopian-reality-of-chinas-livestreaming-craze\">Inside the Dystopian Reality of China\\'s Livestreaming Craze</a> -- <i>Livestreaming exacts a huge mental toll on the people who do it.

Would de-biasing language around race and ethnicity achieve the same (lack of) result? I would like to see that studied; Robyn Speer’s work, described in “<a href=\"http://blog.conceptnet.io/posts/2017/how-to-make-a-racist-ai-without-really-trying/\">How To Make a Racist AI Without Really Trying</a>,” suggests that de-biasing for race is at least partially successful; though, Speer asks: “Can we stop worrying about algorithmic racism? No. Have we made the problem a lot smaller? Definitely.” I hope she’s right; I’m less convinced now than I was a few months ago. I can certainly imagine racial stereotypes persisting even after bias has been removed. What about anti-semitic language? What about other stereotypes? One researcher I know discovered an enterprise security application that was biased against salespeople, who were considered more likely to engage in risky behavior.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We’re uncovering biases that are basic to our use of language. It shouldn’t surprise anyone that these biases are built in to the way we communicate, and that they go fairly deep. We can remove gender as a factor in word embeddings, but that doesn’t help much. Turkish, for example, doesn’t have gendered pronouns, a fact that has revealed <a href=\"https://qz.com/1141122/google-translates-gender-bias-pairs-he-with-hardworking-and-she-with-lazy-and-other-examples/\">gender bias in automated translation</a>, where gender-neutral Turkish sentences are translated as gender-specific English sentences. But no one would claim that gender bias doesn’t exist in Turkish; it’s just encoded differently. Likewise, we can remove race and ethnicity as a factor in word embeddings, but that, at best, leaves us with a smaller problem. Language is only a symptom of bigger issues. These biases are part of what we are, and these word associations, including the associations we’d prefer to disown, are part of what makes language work.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The problem we’re facing in natural language processing (as in any application of machine learning) is that <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-we-learn-from-ais-biases\">fairness is aspirational and forward looking</a>; data can only be historical, and therefore necessarily reflects the biases and prejudices of the past. Learning how to de-bias our applications is progress, but the only real solution is to become better people. That’s more easily said than done; it’s not clear that being more conscious about how we talk will remove these hidden biases, any more than rewriting “he” and “she” as “they.” And being too conscious of how we talk can easily lead to a constant state of self-censorship that makes conversation impossible, and specifically the kinds of conversations we need to make progress.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If there’s any one thing that will remove those biases, it is being more aware of how we act. Returning to Gonem and Goldberg’s study of professional stereotypes: the way to change those problematic word embeddings permanently isn’t to tweak the data, but to make hiring decisions that aren’t based on stereotypes, and to treat the people we hire fairly and with respect, regardless of gender (or race or ethnicity). If we act differently, our language will inevitably change to reflect our actions.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I am hopeful that machine learning will help us leave behind a biased and prejudiced past, and build a future that’s more fair and equitable. But machine learning won’t make prejudice disappear by forcing us to rely on data when the data itself is biased. And the myth that the apparent abstraction and mathematical rationality of machine learning is unbiased only lends the prestige of math and science to prejudice and stereotype. If machine learning is going to help, we’ll need to understand that progress is incremental, not absolute. Machine learning is a tool, not a magic wand, and it’s capable of being misused. It can hold a mirror to our biases, or it can hide them.

Along the way, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-are-machine-learning-engineers\">we described a new job role and title—machine learning engineer</a>—focused on creating data products and making data science work in production, a role that was beginning to emerge in the San Francisco Bay Area two years ago. At that time, there weren’t any popular tools aimed at solving the problems facing teams tasked with putting machine learning into practice.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>About 10 months ago, Databricks announced <a href=\"https://mlflow.org/\">MLflow</a>, a new open source project for managing machine learning development (full disclosure: Ben Lorica is an advisor to Databricks). We thought that given the lack of clear open source alternatives, MLflow had a decent chance of gaining traction, and this has proven to be the case. Over a relatively short time period, MLflow has garnered more than 3,300 stars on GitHub and 80 contributors from more than 40 companies. Most significantly, more than 200 companies are now using MLflow.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So, why is this new open source project resonating with data scientists and machine learning engineers? Recall the following <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/julesdamji/whats-next-for-mlflow-in-2019\">key attributes of a machine learning</a> project:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Unlike traditional software where the goal is to meet a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_specification\">functional specification</a>, in ML the goal is to optimize a metric.</li>\\n\\t<li>Quality depends not just on code, but also on data, tuning, regular updates, and retraining.</li>\\n\\t<li>Those involved with ML usually want to experiment with new libraries, algorithms, and data sources—and thus, one must be able to put those new components into production.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>MLflow’s success can be attributed to a lightweight “open interface” that allows users to hook up their favorite machine learning libraries, and the availability of three components that users can pick and choose from (i.e., they can use one, two, or all three of the following):</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6nGie\"><img alt=\"MLflow components\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/image1-92b33f611d3324e705884d2896ecdcda.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>Image by Matei Zaharia; used with permission.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n<p>The fact that one can pick and choose which MLflow component(s) to use means the project is able to quickly serve the needs of a diverse set of users. Based on an upcoming survey we conducted of MLflow users, here are some of the most popular use cases:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Tracking and managing large numbers of machine learning experiments: MLflow is useful for an individual data scientist tracking his/her own experiments, but it is also designed to be used by companies with large teams of machine learning developers who are using it to track thousands of models.</li>\\n\\t<li>MLflow is being used to manage multi-step machine learning pipelines.</li>\\n\\t<li>Model packaging: companies are using MLflow to incorporate custom logic and dependencies as part of a model’s package abstraction before deploying it to their production environment (example: a recommendation system might be programmed to not display certain images to minors).</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The upcoming <a href=\"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v0.9.0\">0.9.0 release has many new features</a>, including support for database stores for the MLflow Tracking Server, which will make it easier for large teams to query and track ongoing and past experiments.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We are still in the early days for tools supporting teams developing machine learning models. Besides MLflow, there are startups like <a href=\"https://www.comet.ml/\">Comet.ml</a> and <a href=\"https://www.verta.ai/\">Verta.ai</a> that are building tools to ease similar pain points. As <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-machine-learning-means-for-software-development\">software development begins to resemble ML development</a> over the next few years, we expect to see more investments in tools.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Model governance</h2>\\n\\n<p>Companies need to look seriously at the improved tools for developing machine learning models, many of which are part of more ambitious tools suites. Machine learning can’t be limited to researchers with Ph.D.s; there aren’t enough of them. Machine learning is in the process of democratization; tools that make it possible for software developers to build and train models are essential to this process.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We’ve also said the number of machine learning models that are deployed in production will increase dramatically: many applications will be built from many models, and many organizations will want to automate many different aspects of their business. And those models will age and need to be re-trained periodically. We’ve become accustomed to the need for data governance and provenance, understanding and controlling the many\\ndatabases that are combined in a modern data-driven application. We’re now realizing the same is true for models, too. Companies will need to track the models they’re building and the models they have in production.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Startups like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bigdata/status/1111420708616204293\">Datatron</a> are beginning to use the term “model governance” to describe the task of tracking and managing models, and they are beginning to build model governance tools into their product suites. This term describes the processes that enterprises and large companies are starting to use to understand the many ML initiatives and projects teams are working on. Regulators are also signalling their interest in products that rely on AI and machine learning, thus systems for managing ML development are going to be required to comply with future legislation. Here are some of the elements that are going to play a role in building a model governance solution:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>A database for authorization and security: who has read/write access to certain models</li>\\n\\t<li>A catalog or a database that lists models, including when they were tested, trained, and deployed</li>\\n\\t<li>Metadata and artifacts needed for audits: as an example, the output from the components of MLflow will be very pertinent for audits</li>\\n\\t<li>Systems for deployment, monitoring, and alerting: who approved and pushed the model out to production, who is able to monitor its performance and receive alerts, and who is responsible for it</li>\\n\\t<li>A dashboard that provides custom views for all principals (operations, ML engineers, data scientists, business owners)</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Traditional software developers have long had tools for managing their projects. These tools serve functions like version control, library management, deployment automation, and more. Machine learning engineers know and use all those tools, but they’re not enough.

Along the way, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-are-machine-learning-engineers\">we described a new job role and title—machine learning engineer</a>—focused on creating data products and making data science work in production, a role that was beginning to emerge in the San Francisco Bay Area two years ago. At that time, there weren’t any popular tools aimed at solving the problems facing teams tasked with putting machine learning into practice.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>About 10 months ago, Databricks announced <a href=\"https://mlflow.org/\">MLflow</a>, a new open source project for managing machine learning development (full disclosure: Ben Lorica is an advisor to Databricks). We thought that given the lack of clear open source alternatives, MLflow had a decent chance of gaining traction, and this has proven to be the case. Over a relatively short time period, MLflow has garnered more than 3,300 stars on GitHub and 80 contributors from more than 40 companies. Most significantly, more than 200 companies are now using MLflow.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So, why is this new open source project resonating with data scientists and machine learning engineers? Recall the following <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/julesdamji/whats-next-for-mlflow-in-2019\">key attributes of a machine learning</a> project:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Unlike traditional software where the goal is to meet a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_specification\">functional specification</a>, in ML the goal is to optimize a metric.</li>\\n\\t<li>Quality depends not just on code, but also on data, tuning, regular updates, and retraining.</li>\\n\\t<li>Those involved with ML usually want to experiment with new libraries, algorithms, and data sources—and thus, one must be able to put those new components into production.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>MLflow’s success can be attributed to a lightweight “open interface” that allows users to hook up their favorite machine learning libraries, and the availability of three components that users can pick and choose from (i.e., they can use one, two, or all three of the following):</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6nGie\"><img alt=\"MLflow components\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/image1-92b33f611d3324e705884d2896ecdcda.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>Image by Matei Zaharia; used with permission.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n<p>The fact that one can pick and choose which MLflow component(s) to use means the project is able to quickly serve the needs of a diverse set of users. Based on an upcoming survey we conducted of MLflow users, here are some of the most popular use cases:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Tracking and managing large numbers of machine learning experiments: MLflow is useful for an individual data scientist tracking his/her own experiments, but it is also designed to be used by companies with large teams of machine learning developers who are using it to track thousands of models.</li>\\n\\t<li>MLflow is being used to manage multi-step machine learning pipelines.</li>\\n\\t<li>Model packaging: companies are using MLflow to incorporate custom logic and dependencies as part of a model’s package abstraction before deploying it to their production environment (example: a recommendation system might be programmed to not display certain images to minors).</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The upcoming <a href=\"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v0.9.0\">0.9.0 release has many new features</a>, including support for database stores for the MLflow Tracking Server, which will make it easier for large teams to query and track ongoing and past experiments.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We are still in the early days for tools supporting teams developing machine learning models. Besides MLflow, there are startups like <a href=\"https://www.comet.ml/\">Comet.ml</a> and <a href=\"https://www.verta.ai/\">Verta.ai</a> that are building tools to ease similar pain points. As <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-machine-learning-means-for-software-development\">software development begins to resemble ML development</a> over the next few years, we expect to see more investments in tools.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Model governance</h2>\\n\\n<p>Companies need to look seriously at the improved tools for developing machine learning models, many of which are part of more ambitious tools suites. Machine learning can’t be limited to researchers with Ph.D.s; there aren’t enough of them. Machine learning is in the process of democratization; tools that make it possible for software developers to build and train models are essential to this process.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We’ve also said the number of machine learning models that are deployed in production will increase dramatically: many applications will be built from many models, and many organizations will want to automate many different aspects of their business. And those models will age and need to be re-trained periodically. We’ve become accustomed to the need for data governance and provenance, understanding and controlling the many\\ndatabases that are combined in a modern data-driven application. We’re now realizing the same is true for models, too. Companies will need to track the models they’re building and the models they have in production.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Startups like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bigdata/status/1111420708616204293\">Datatron</a> are beginning to use the term “model governance” to describe the task of tracking and managing models, and they are beginning to build model governance tools into their product suites. This term describes the processes that enterprises and large companies are starting to use to understand the many ML initiatives and projects teams are working on. Regulators are also signalling their interest in products that rely on AI and machine learning, thus systems for managing ML development are going to be required to comply with future legislation. Here are some of the elements that are going to play a role in building a model governance solution:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>A database for authorization and security: who has read/write access to certain models</li>\\n\\t<li>A catalog or a database that lists models, including when they were tested, trained, and deployed</li>\\n\\t<li>Metadata and artifacts needed for audits: as an example, the output from the components of MLflow will be very pertinent for audits</li>\\n\\t<li>Systems for deployment, monitoring, and alerting: who approved and pushed the model out to production, who is able to monitor its performance and receive alerts, and who is responsible for it</li>\\n\\t<li>A dashboard that provides custom views for all principals (operations, ML engineers, data scientists, business owners)</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Traditional software developers have long had tools for managing their projects. These tools serve functions like version control, library management, deployment automation, and more. Machine learning engineers know and use all those tools, but they’re not enough. We’re beginning to see the tool suits that provide the features that machine learning engineers need, including tools for model governance, tracking experiments, and packaging models so that results are repeatable. The next big step in the democratization of machine learning is making it more manageable: not simply hand-crafted artisanal solutions, but solutions that make machine learning manageable and deployable at enterprise scale.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Related resources</strong>:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>\\n<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-are-machine-learning-engineers\">“What are machine learning engineers?”</a>: a new role focused on creating data products and making data science work in production</li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-machine-learning-means-for-software-development\">“What machine learning means for software development”</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-automation-in-machine-learning\">“Deep automation in machine learning”</a></li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-is-hardcore-data-science-in-practice\">“What is hardcore data science—in practice?”</a>: the anatomy of an architecture to bring data science into production</li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-turning-machine-learning-models-into-real-products-and-services\">“Lessons learned turning machine learning models into real products and services”</a></li>\\n\\t<li>Harish Doddi on <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/simplifying-machine-learning-lifecycle-management\">“Simplifying machine learning lifecycle management”</a>\\n</li>\\n\\t<li>Jesse Anderson and Paco Nathan on <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-machine-learning-engineers-need-to-know\">“What machine learning engineers need to know”</a>\\n</li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/data-engineers-vs-data-scientists\">“Data engineers vs. data scientists”</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential\\'>Specialized tools for machine learning development and model governance are becoming essential.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/4tBUslVoW9c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>', 'links': [{'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/4tBUslVoW9c/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Ben Lorica, Mike Loukides'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Ben Lorica, Mike Loukides'}, 'author': 'Ben Lorica, Mike Loukides', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential'}, {'title': 'Four short links: 2 April 2019', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Four short links: 2 April 2019'}, 'updated': '2019-04-02T10:45:00Z', 'updated_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=4, tm_mday=2, tm_hour=10, tm_min=45, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=92, tm_isdst=0), 'id': 'tag:www.oreilly.com,2019-04-02:/ideas/four-short-links-2-april-2019', 'guidislink': True, 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/xOw7QMc5awQ/four-short-links-2-april-2019', 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': '<p><em>Content Moderation, Speech in 1.6kbps, Science is Hard, and Forensic Typography</em></p><ol>\\r\\n<li>\\r\\n<a href=\"https://onezero.medium.com/your-speech-their-rules-meet-the-people-who-guard-the-internet-ab58fe6b9231\">Your Speech, Their Rules: Meet the People Who Guard the Internet</a> (Medium) -- <i>Adam: “Six months ago we told you, ‘Don’t pave the city with banana peels.’ You decided, ‘Let’s see what happens if we pave the city with banana peels.’ We are now here to clean up the injuries.”</i>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n<li>\\r\\n<a href=\"https://people.xiph.org/~jm/demo/lpcnet_codec/\">A Real-Time Wideband Neural Vocoder at 1.6 kb/s Using LPCNet</a> -- this is witchcraft.

This, of course, is in an effort to move forward the culture of open source, from static code branches sitting in source trees to living and evolving useful systems ready for live interaction, still egalitarian and open access in nature.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At the heart of this vision lie practically immutable accounting systems that store the widely accepted state of the world to ensure global integrity. Large visions are rarely achieved in one fell swoop and are instead typically realized through the emergence of solutions for related and meaningful short-term problems. The volatility problem is one such important candidate.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Due to the nascency of cryptocurrency markets, volatility has remained a staple for both outside observers and users. Although traders may fare well from the conditions, those wishing to use the assets in particular and unlock the true value of these accounting systems may have a different experience altogether. An asset bought as a medium of exchange (MoE) may lose its value before any value from spending that asset has truly been captured.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The volatility problem is important to solve because its resolution in the short-term unlocks the financial and technical engineering groundwork necessary for cheap, swift, secure, and disintermediated global payment systems based on blockchains. Users of these systems will be able to transact seamlessly with peers at a far cheaper rate and with a dramatic increase of security due to the nature of these cryptographic systems. In the long term, solving this problem will vastly reduce the barrier to entry for use of smart contract-based services on public, consortium, and private blockchains—truly unlocking the automation value these technologies have to offer.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A cryptocurrency-based contender that has appeared in order to solve this crisis is called a stablecoin. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that is pegged by various means to a traditional fiat currency to maintain its price or is backed by precious metals and other commodities. To date, there have been stablecoins backed by fiat currencies in reserve, gold, and even cryptocurrency itself. Although some have failed and lost their desired peg, recent iterations have proven quite successful so far in their stability.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Value opportunity: Digital money</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The digital money industry is booming, driven in recent years especially by the Asia-Pacific region. In 2017, the revenue opportunities exceeded $1.9 trillion, trending double-digit percentage growth per year. While cryptocurrencies have many desirable properties for digital payments, such as low transaction fees, asset transfer simplicity, and auditability, the price volatility of mainstream cryptocurrencies is currently untenable for production use cases. Wild price swings are not good for buying groceries and paying rent. Simple tasks become unreasonably complex, as accounting loses its stability on a multitude of scales.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For example, cross-border payments are easy to facilitate with cryptocurrencies but their value fluctuation makes the process unreasonably complicated. If a farmer in an emerging economy wishes to send their family cryptocurrency, they must account for price fluctuations that may devalue the asset at a double-digit percentage before it can be liquidated for a local currency. Stablecoins have the opportunity to reap the benefits of cryptocurrencies while mitigating price volatility to acceptable levels.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Value opportunity: Open platforms</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Smart contracting platforms have the potential to solve problems “once and for all,” in the same vein as cloud service providers touting infrastructural block storage (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob) and computing power (Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure Compute). Due to their open nature, smart contracts may easily extend to the application layer and offer turnkey solutions to digital money, trade financing, supply chain management, and sharing economies.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Smart contracts can run at cost without intermediaries carving out high margins, a paradigm similar to well-run public utilities. However, the dominant way to pay for smart contract-based goods and services has been with volatile cryptocurrencies, adding currency risk to businesses that operate on more stable national currencies such as dollars, yuan, or euros. Alternatively, businesses may choose to purchase exact amounts of volatile cryptocurrencies as necessary, minimizing currency exposure but incurring new transaction fees with each subsequent transaction.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With the rise of stablecoins, businesses incur smaller currency risks and transaction fees. Due to a guarantee on the price of the asset being processed, there is minimal volatility risk and users and businesses alike can benefit from this stability. This can, in turn, drive adoption for smart contract systems due to reduced risk and improved ease of use. Businesses feel safer due to the benefits of automation and lower transaction costs, and users feel safer in knowing their personal assets won’t be devalued.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Stablecoin history</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Stablecoins aren’t a new revelation in the cryptocurrency space, as attempts at their implementations have been in motion since 2014. The first two attempts at creating stablecoins came from both BitUSD of BitShares, and NuBits—both of which were crypto collateralized iterations. Although both failed due to collateralization instability, they paved the way for new iterations that learned from their mistakes as well as strengthened the case for a price-stable asset represented as a cryptocurrency.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The first implementation of a reserved back stablecoin came in late 2014 from Tether, which was initially built on Bitcoin through the Omni layer. Although Tether offered the creation and redemption process typically associated with reserve backed stablecoins, its lack of transparency paved the way for transparent reserve backed stablecoins such as CENTRE’s USDC and Gemini’s GUSD.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are, in fact, three types of stablecoin implementations: reserve backed, crypto collateralized, and algorithmic, each with its own associated risks and tradeoffs. While reserve backed implementations provide transparency and absolute stability from natural arbitrage opportunities, there is added counterparty risk from the centralized controller. Crypto collateralized implementations forego counterparty risk at the expense of the volatility from their underlying collateral. Algorithmic stablecoins are dependent on incentive mechanisms and speculation, and haven’t had a proven implementation yet. However, all three are interesting in their approaches and allow users to gauge their comfort in using their choice of asset.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Stablecoin implementation types</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Reserve backed</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A reserve backed stablecoin is one that is typically issued by a central provider and is backed 1:1 to a fiat currency by means of both a tokenization and redemption process. To generate new tokens, customers send collateral to the provider, and the provider then mints or creates new tokens. The provider typically has the underlying collateral under custody with regular attestation reports, and “burns” or removes the tokens from circulation once they are redeemed.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Recent examples of reserve backed stablecoins include Gemini’s GUSD, CENTRE’s USDC, and Paxos’ PAX. Legacy reserve backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) has suffered much scrutiny due to the provider’s lack of regular auditing of the underlying collateral. However, the latest class of reserve backed stablecoins have been consistently providing audit reports from reputable firms.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Reserve backed stablecoins typically retain their peg from arbitrage cycles. For example, if Gemini’s GUSD is trading under $1, arbitrageurs are incentivized to buy the asset until it stabilizes and redeem the tokens for the underlying collateral, thereby making a profit. If the asset is trading over $1, arbitrageurs are incentivized to send collateral to Gemini in order to generate new tokens and sell them for the higher rate.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Typically in these systems, there’s an increased counterparty risk due to the ability of the central provider to freeze assets at any time. This issue came up recently with <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/winklevoss-crypto-gemini-gusd-stablecoin-redemption\">Gemini customers having redemption issues</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Crypto collateralized</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A crypto collateralized stablecoin is one that has cryptocurrency as its underlying collateral and uses price feeds associated with the collateral as a means of keeping the stablecoin at one dollar. In the case of crypto collateralized stablecoins, plenty of projects have made the attempt at stabilizing a system, but none have succeeded as much as MakerDAO.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Originally launched in 2017, DAI, the crypto collateralized stablecoin from the MakerDAO project, has remained relatively stable with continued development interest. Currently, DAI is collateralized by Ether (ETH), the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, and the project plans on utilizing other assets for collateral in the future. Users wishing to obtain DAI must first lock ETH in a “CDP,” or collateralized debt position. Due to the high volatility of ETH, DAI is typically overcollateralized at rates well over 100%.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If an individual’s CDP is ever close to being insolvent, the system triggers the sale of the user’s underlying collateral. If the system ever becomes insolvent due to a market crash in the price of the underlying collateral, Maker or “MKR,” the other token in the MakerDAO system, acts as a buyer of last resort where new MKR tokens are minted, effectively diluting current holders, and sold on the open market as a means of stabilizing the system.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>MKR holders are responsible for voting on resolutions and regulating the entire system through MakerDAO’s governance mechanisms. A fee in MKR is also paid to open CDPs to acquire DAI, effectively reducing the supply as more are opened.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Currently, the key centralized aspect with the most risk in MakerDAO’s system is its oracles that generate price feeds for the underlying collateral. Other centralized actors include “keepers,” or automated market makers that keep DAI around its target price. Considering limited arbitrage opportunities on a redemption process such as DAIs, external mechanisms such as these must be consulted to maintain stability.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Algorithmic</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The last major implementation of stablecoins is based on algorithms that trigger supply inflation and deflation in relation to the stablecoin’s target price. Algorithmic stablecoins aren’t backed by collateral, but rather have speculators involved with associated secondary and tertiary assets to keep the system balanced.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Algorithmic stablecoins are typically reliant on an elastic supply scheme building on Robert Sam’s Seigniorage Shares, where a base stable-asset is produced, but secondary and even tertiary assets generated and redeemed to ensure system stability. Seigniorage generally involves profiting from the creation of currency; the difference in the cost of the production of money and the money itself. In an algorithmic system, speculation on the secondary and tertiary assets to keep an algorithmic system stable is designed to yield a profit. One recent example of an attempt at creating such a system was Basis, a project seeking to build an algorithmic model that recently refunded investors.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Basis model included three tokens: a stablecoin to retain its peg at one dollar, and “bonds” and “shares” that act as the secondary and tertiary assets. Bonds are created by the system during periods of price decline under the desired peg and are purchased using the stablecoin to deflate its supply and increase its price. The bonds are immediately redeemed once the price reaches above its target of $1. Shares act as a hedge on a healthy system, as shareholders are granted newly minted stablecoins if all bonds have been redeemed and the stablecoin continues to trade above $1. The inflation mechanism of the stablecoin is meant to drive the price down, as shareholders are granted tokens from it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To date, no algorithmic stablecoin has launched successfully. The next attempt at an algorithmic stablecoin launch will likely come from Carbon, and their CUSD stablecoin. At the moment, Carbon is fully collateralized by U.S. dollars held in bank accounts, but they plan on eventually transitioning to an alternative system.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>A plethora of implementations</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There is no shortage of projects wishing to issue stablecoins, as it has become quite a hot topic in recent times. To date, there are more than a dozen launched stablecoin projects with more continually being developed to serve different purposes. Most of them have been pegged to the U.S. dollar, but there are a few examples being collateralized by other fiat currencies and commodities. The most notable of which is Digix—which is backed by gold held in a custodial vault. Being able to leverage cost savings internally to an existing ecosystem is one of the primary use cases for institutions and enterprise companies to partner with or create their own stablecoin.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Last year, in particular, saw a dramatic rise in the number of reserved backed stablecoins that launched. Businesses such as Paxos, Gemini, and Circle saw the benefits of launching these assets and have since been building lofty ecosystems around their respective assets. They have also set the standard in regular auditing, providing attestation reports for each asset on a regular basis. This further lowers the risk profile of these assets while providing a safety mechanism to encourage originally skeptic outsiders to finally enter and interface with these technologies.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Volatility mitigation in production</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In order to reap the benefits of stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi) services are beginning to accept stablecoins as a means of interfacing with services. DeFi services are those that provide traditional financial services while ensuring transactions are protected, peer to peer, and that users retain custody of their assets at all times. Examples of these services include exchanges, automated asset management funds, and debt platforms.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One example of such a service is <a href=\"https://dharma.io/\">Dharma </a>—a suite of decentralized lending products. Dharma’s main product involves peer-to-peer lending where users can collateralize their cryptocurrencies in exchange for Ethereum or USDC—a stablecoin. This would allow risk to be averted, as the recipient would be able to avoid market volatility upon receiving a stablecoin. Even <a href=\"https://blockfi.com/\">BlockFi</a>, a competitor to Dharma, recently announced the integration of GUSD on their platform to help users avoid volatility.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Decentralized exchanges have also taken note of stablecoins and have continually added them as an available asset for trading. For example, <a href=\"https://blog.ethfinex.com/announcing-dai-integration-da1484ed86f/\">Ethfinex</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/ddex/ddex-makerdao-an-intro-to-decentralized-leveraged-trading-f76995fd9239\">DDex</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.kyber.network/kyber-network-lists-its-first-stablecoin-20fb6ba35d6\">Kyber Network</a> have all listed DAI on their exchanges in order to better assist new traders and those who need to exchange assets and avoid risk after liquidation. Even seasoned traders can now use DAI in order to hedge risk in short-term market fluctuations and benefit from its stability.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are a number of additional projects in the process of launching this year, including MelonPort, an asset management protocol, and Origin, a marketplace generation protocol that will also accept stablecoins as a way to mitigate volatility risk. The increase in stablecoin adoption is a positive signaling mechanism that is demonstrating a natural fit. As more decentralized applications and protocols continue to be developed, stablecoins will naturally serve as a transactional asset to greatly benefit end users.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Mass proliferation, or “One to Rule Them All”</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The recent announcement of the <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/news/digital-coin-payments\">JPM Coin</a>, a stablecoin by J.P. Morgan (which clearly demonstrates an institutional interest in the space), is going to usher in a wave of stablecoins in the next few years. These assets will range from other sovereign-backed fiat currencies such as the Yuan, Yen, and Euro, to other traditional commodities such as precious metals and rare earth minerals. However, their implementations will definitely take note of current iterations that provide a regular price peg free from value fluctuation (if a fiat currency), the least amount of risk for users.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The reasoning is that in the short to medium term, stablecoins provide an entrance toward a new financial system. Through this stable onramp into blockchain systems, users need not worry about market volatility when thinking about traditional payments, nor do they need to worry about open platform access being rescinded due to a market downturn. They provide predictability in price and provide a way to sideline funds during market swings without having to pay additional fees moving back into fiat.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is unlikely in the long term that there will be as many stablecoins as are currently available and being developed. While there won’t be a single controlling stablecoin due to the myriad of assets they could be pegged to, there will be a basket that commands a majority of the trading volume. Even with all of its historical issues, Tether still commands a vast majority of trading volume relative to other stablecoins simply because of its social relativity and continued redemption and minting arbitrage opportunities. Competition will drive pricing down and force the technology to grow quickly, but will also result in low or negative margins for the firms producing these but not operating at efficient enough scale.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The other inherent risk is to consider if and when cryptocurrencies reach a sufficiently high market capitalization and trading interest. Once enough volume reaches traditional medium of exchange (MoE) cryptocurrencies, prices may begin to plateau and stabilize due to a lack of illiquidity. If Bitcoin were to reach over a sufficient amount of trading volume, having a daily price fluctuation of 10%+ would be highly unlikely, lessening the value proposition of stablecoins. However, stablecoins for the foreseeable future will continue to provide a key stability mechanism by way of the policy and monetary controls we are starting to see implemented in some popular stablecoins today.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Allowing stablecoins to have monetary controls in place allows not just users but regulators and institutional entities to have a comfortable experience with a traditionally volatile asset class. Enterprises didn’t jump right into cloud computing, and to this day most still have at least some of their processes run locally—this will most likely be the same case for stablecoins and their adoption. Facebook has recently been <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-21/facebook-is-said-to-develop-stablecoin-for-whatsapp-transfers\">noted to be working on</a> a stablecoin with their WhatsApp messenger and have been testing it in India. This allows them to govern the monetary policy inside of their apps and build pathways into and out of their ecosystems. Not only does this allow them to save on transaction fees associated with more traditional systems, but it also allows them to guarantee stability in their walled gardens while using cryptocurrency. Facebook being an already digitally native company allows them to test the cost savings aspects while also complying with various regulatory requirements for their users across geographic lines.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As the stablecoin ecosystem continues to grow between enterprise players and existing blockchain ecosystem players such as Gemini and Coinbase, users will continue to have the freedom and flexibility to transition between fiat and crypto seamlessly, and more importantly, be granted the stability needed to avoid cryptocurrency’s current volatility crisis.</p>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/stablecoins-solving-the-cryptocurrency-volatility-crisis\\'>Stablecoins: Solving the cryptocurrency volatility crisis.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/-W4CZU2cC8Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",
       "  'summary': '<p><img src=\\'https://d3ucjech6zwjp8.cloudfront.net/600x450/tree-stump-2433166_1920_crop-4d463fffe27b3f4d02be8cc19609d71e.jpg\\'/></p><p><em>Resolving the volatility problem will unlock the groundwork needed for blockchain-based global payment systems.</em></p><p>For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, the long game of blockchain ecosystems is to create open platforms controlled by no single authority, inviting open participation from anyone. This, of course, is in an effort to move forward the culture of open source, from static code branches sitting in source trees to living and evolving useful systems ready for live interaction, still egalitarian and open access in nature.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At the heart of this vision lie practically immutable accounting systems that store the widely accepted state of the world to ensure global integrity. Large visions are rarely achieved in one fell swoop and are instead typically realized through the emergence of solutions for related and meaningful short-term problems. The volatility problem is one such important candidate.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Due to the nascency of cryptocurrency markets, volatility has remained a staple for both outside observers and users. Although traders may fare well from the conditions, those wishing to use the assets in particular and unlock the true value of these accounting systems may have a different experience altogether. An asset bought as a medium of exchange (MoE) may lose its value before any value from spending that asset has truly been captured.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The volatility problem is important to solve because its resolution in the short-term unlocks the financial and technical engineering groundwork necessary for cheap, swift, secure, and disintermediated global payment systems based on blockchains. Users of these systems will be able to transact seamlessly with peers at a far cheaper rate and with a dramatic increase of security due to the nature of these cryptographic systems. In the long term, solving this problem will vastly reduce the barrier to entry for use of smart contract-based services on public, consortium, and private blockchains—truly unlocking the automation value these technologies have to offer.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A cryptocurrency-based contender that has appeared in order to solve this crisis is called a stablecoin. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that is pegged by various means to a traditional fiat currency to maintain its price or is backed by precious metals and other commodities. To date, there have been stablecoins backed by fiat currencies in reserve, gold, and even cryptocurrency itself. Although some have failed and lost their desired peg, recent iterations have proven quite successful so far in their stability.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Value opportunity: Digital money</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The digital money industry is booming, driven in recent years especially by the Asia-Pacific region. In 2017, the revenue opportunities exceeded $1.9 trillion, trending double-digit percentage growth per year. While cryptocurrencies have many desirable properties for digital payments, such as low transaction fees, asset transfer simplicity, and auditability, the price volatility of mainstream cryptocurrencies is currently untenable for production use cases. Wild price swings are not good for buying groceries and paying rent. Simple tasks become unreasonably complex, as accounting loses its stability on a multitude of scales.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For example, cross-border payments are easy to facilitate with cryptocurrencies but their value fluctuation makes the process unreasonably complicated. If a farmer in an emerging economy wishes to send their family cryptocurrency, they must account for price fluctuations that may devalue the asset at a double-digit percentage before it can be liquidated for a local currency. Stablecoins have the opportunity to reap the benefits of cryptocurrencies while mitigating price volatility to acceptable levels.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Value opportunity: Open platforms</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Smart contracting platforms have the potential to solve problems “once and for all,” in the same vein as cloud service providers touting infrastructural block storage (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob) and computing power (Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure Compute). Due to their open nature, smart contracts may easily extend to the application layer and offer turnkey solutions to digital money, trade financing, supply chain management, and sharing economies.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Smart contracts can run at cost without intermediaries carving out high margins, a paradigm similar to well-run public utilities. However, the dominant way to pay for smart contract-based goods and services has been with volatile cryptocurrencies, adding currency risk to businesses that operate on more stable national currencies such as dollars, yuan, or euros. Alternatively, businesses may choose to purchase exact amounts of volatile cryptocurrencies as necessary, minimizing currency exposure but incurring new transaction fees with each subsequent transaction.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With the rise of stablecoins, businesses incur smaller currency risks and transaction fees. Due to a guarantee on the price of the asset being processed, there is minimal volatility risk and users and businesses alike can benefit from this stability. This can, in turn, drive adoption for smart contract systems due to reduced risk and improved ease of use. Businesses feel safer due to the benefits of automation and lower transaction costs, and users feel safer in knowing their personal assets won’t be devalued.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Stablecoin history</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Stablecoins aren’t a new revelation in the cryptocurrency space, as attempts at their implementations have been in motion since 2014. The first two attempts at creating stablecoins came from both BitUSD of BitShares, and NuBits—both of which were crypto collateralized iterations. Although both failed due to collateralization instability, they paved the way for new iterations that learned from their mistakes as well as strengthened the case for a price-stable asset represented as a cryptocurrency.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The first implementation of a reserved back stablecoin came in late 2014 from Tether, which was initially built on Bitcoin through the Omni layer. Although Tether offered the creation and redemption process typically associated with reserve backed stablecoins, its lack of transparency paved the way for transparent reserve backed stablecoins such as CENTRE’s USDC and Gemini’s GUSD.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are, in fact, three types of stablecoin implementations: reserve backed, crypto collateralized, and algorithmic, each with its own associated risks and tradeoffs. While reserve backed implementations provide transparency and absolute stability from natural arbitrage opportunities, there is added counterparty risk from the centralized controller. Crypto collateralized implementations forego counterparty risk at the expense of the volatility from their underlying collateral. Algorithmic stablecoins are dependent on incentive mechanisms and speculation, and haven’t had a proven implementation yet. However, all three are interesting in their approaches and allow users to gauge their comfort in using their choice of asset.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Stablecoin implementation types</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Reserve backed</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A reserve backed stablecoin is one that is typically issued by a central provider and is backed 1:1 to a fiat currency by means of both a tokenization and redemption process. To generate new tokens, customers send collateral to the provider, and the provider then mints or creates new tokens. The provider typically has the underlying collateral under custody with regular attestation reports, and “burns” or removes the tokens from circulation once they are redeemed.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Recent examples of reserve backed stablecoins include Gemini’s GUSD, CENTRE’s USDC, and Paxos’ PAX. Legacy reserve backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) has suffered much scrutiny due to the provider’s lack of regular auditing of the underlying collateral. However, the latest class of reserve backed stablecoins have been consistently providing audit reports from reputable firms.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Reserve backed stablecoins typically retain their peg from arbitrage cycles. For example, if Gemini’s GUSD is trading under $1, arbitrageurs are incentivized to buy the asset until it stabilizes and redeem the tokens for the underlying collateral, thereby making a profit. If the asset is trading over $1, arbitrageurs are incentivized to send collateral to Gemini in order to generate new tokens and sell them for the higher rate.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Typically in these systems, there’s an increased counterparty risk due to the ability of the central provider to freeze assets at any time. This issue came up recently with <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/winklevoss-crypto-gemini-gusd-stablecoin-redemption\">Gemini customers having redemption issues</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Crypto collateralized</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A crypto collateralized stablecoin is one that has cryptocurrency as its underlying collateral and uses price feeds associated with the collateral as a means of keeping the stablecoin at one dollar. In the case of crypto collateralized stablecoins, plenty of projects have made the attempt at stabilizing a system, but none have succeeded as much as MakerDAO.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Originally launched in 2017, DAI, the crypto collateralized stablecoin from the MakerDAO project, has remained relatively stable with continued development interest. Currently, DAI is collateralized by Ether (ETH), the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, and the project plans on utilizing other assets for collateral in the future. Users wishing to obtain DAI must first lock ETH in a “CDP,” or collateralized debt position. Due to the high volatility of ETH, DAI is typically overcollateralized at rates well over 100%.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If an individual’s CDP is ever close to being insolvent, the system triggers the sale of the user’s underlying collateral. If the system ever becomes insolvent due to a market crash in the price of the underlying collateral, Maker or “MKR,” the other token in the MakerDAO system, acts as a buyer of last resort where new MKR tokens are minted, effectively diluting current holders, and sold on the open market as a means of stabilizing the system.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>MKR holders are responsible for voting on resolutions and regulating the entire system through MakerDAO’s governance mechanisms. A fee in MKR is also paid to open CDPs to acquire DAI, effectively reducing the supply as more are opened.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Currently, the key centralized aspect with the most risk in MakerDAO’s system is its oracles that generate price feeds for the underlying collateral. Other centralized actors include “keepers,” or automated market makers that keep DAI around its target price. Considering limited arbitrage opportunities on a redemption process such as DAIs, external mechanisms such as these must be consulted to maintain stability.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Algorithmic</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The last major implementation of stablecoins is based on algorithms that trigger supply inflation and deflation in relation to the stablecoin’s target price. Algorithmic stablecoins aren’t backed by collateral, but rather have speculators involved with associated secondary and tertiary assets to keep the system balanced.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Algorithmic stablecoins are typically reliant on an elastic supply scheme building on Robert Sam’s Seigniorage Shares, where a base stable-asset is produced, but secondary and even tertiary assets generated and redeemed to ensure system stability. Seigniorage generally involves profiting from the creation of currency; the difference in the cost of the production of money and the money itself. In an algorithmic system, speculation on the secondary and tertiary assets to keep an algorithmic system stable is designed to yield a profit. One recent example of an attempt at creating such a system was Basis, a project seeking to build an algorithmic model that recently refunded investors.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Basis model included three tokens: a stablecoin to retain its peg at one dollar, and “bonds” and “shares” that act as the secondary and tertiary assets. Bonds are created by the system during periods of price decline under the desired peg and are purchased using the stablecoin to deflate its supply and increase its price. The bonds are immediately redeemed once the price reaches above its target of $1. Shares act as a hedge on a healthy system, as shareholders are granted newly minted stablecoins if all bonds have been redeemed and the stablecoin continues to trade above $1. The inflation mechanism of the stablecoin is meant to drive the price down, as shareholders are granted tokens from it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To date, no algorithmic stablecoin has launched successfully. The next attempt at an algorithmic stablecoin launch will likely come from Carbon, and their CUSD stablecoin. At the moment, Carbon is fully collateralized by U.S. dollars held in bank accounts, but they plan on eventually transitioning to an alternative system.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>A plethora of implementations</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There is no shortage of projects wishing to issue stablecoins, as it has become quite a hot topic in recent times.

Machine learning needs to ensure privacy, both of the training data and the model, and needs to be fair and invulnerable to tampering. The tools we need to create Safe ML have been under development among cryptographers for the past 30 years, well before modern machine learning became practical.

There are a lot of things you can say about Amazon\\'s business practices, but almost nobody criticizes the ease with which you can return merchandise. What other opportunities are there?

He would have to ask an engineer to do it for him.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>–Gordon Lindsay Glegg, <em>The Design of Design (1969)</em></p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A few months ago, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/data-engineers-vs-data-scientists\">I wrote</a> about the differences between data engineers and data scientists. I talked about their skills and common starting points.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>An interesting thing happened: the data scientists started pushing back, arguing that they are, in fact, as skilled as data engineers at data engineering. That was interesting because the data engineers didn’t push back saying they’re data scientists.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So, I’ve spent the past few months gathering data and observing the behaviors of data scientists in their natural habitat. This post will offer more information about why a data scientist is not a data engineer.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Why does this even matter?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Some people complained that this data scientist versus data engineer is a mere focus on titles. “Titles shouldn’t hold people back from learning or doing new things,” they argued. I agree; learn as much as you can. Just know that your learning may only scratch the surface of what’s necessary to put something in production. Otherwise, this leads to failure with big data projects.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It’s also feeding into the management level at companies. They’re hiring data scientists <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2017/03/what-happens-when-you-hire-a-data-scientist-without-a-data-engineer/\">expecting them</a> to be data engineers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I’ve heard this same story from a number of companies. They all play out the same: a company decides that data science is the way to get VC money, tons of ROI, mad street cred in their business circle, or some other reasons. This decision happens at C-level or VP-level. Let’s call this C-level person Alice.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The company goes on an exhaustive search to find the best data scientist ever. Let’s call this data scientist Bob.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It’s Bob’s first day. Alice comes up to Bob and excitedly tells him about all the projects she has in mind.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“That’s great. Where are these data pipelines and where is your Spark cluster?” Bob asks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Alice responds, “That’s what we’re expecting you to do. We hired you to do data science.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“I don’t know how to do any of that,” says Bob.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Alice looks at him quizzically, “But you’re a data scientist. Right? This is what you do.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“No, I use the data pipelines and data products that are already created.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Alice goes back to her office to figure out what happened. She stares at overly simplistic diagrams like the one shown in Figure 1 and can’t figure out why Bob can’t do the simple big data tasks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6KGiJ\"><img alt=\"venn diagram with data scientists and data engineers\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure1-42ac4b8503ed9b17c941d48f6c81f147.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>Overly simplistic venn diagram with data scientists and data engineers.

Later on, we’ll talk about the data scientists themselves.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Let’s face it. Data engineering is not in the limelight. It isn’t being proclaimed as the best job of the 21st century. It isn’t getting all of the media buzz. Conferences aren’t telling CxOs about the virtues of data engineering. If you only look at the cursory message, it’s all about data science and hiring data scientists.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This is starting to change. We have conferences on data engineering. There is a gradual recognition of the need for data engineering. I’m hoping pieces like this one shed light on this necessity. I’m hoping my body of work will educate organizations on this critical need.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Recognition and appreciation</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Even when organizations have data science and data engineering teams, there is still a lack of appreciation for the work that went into the data engineering side.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You even see this lack of credit during conference talks. The data scientist is talking about what they’ve created. I can see the extensive data engineering that went into their model, but it’s never called out during the talk. I don’t expect the talk to cover it in detail, but it would be nice to acknowledge the work that went into enabling their creation. Management and beginners to data science perceive that everything was possible with the data scientist’s skill set.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>How to get appreciation</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Lately, I’ve been getting questions from data engineers on how to get into their company’s limelight. They’re feeling that when a data scientist goes to show their latest creation, they’re either taking all of the credit or they’re given all of the credit by the management. Their basic question is: “How can I get the data scientists to stop taking credit for something that was both of our work?”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That’s a valid question from what I’m seeing at companies. Management doesn’t realize (and it isn’t socialized) the data engineering work that goes into all things data science. If you’re reading this and you’re thinking:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>My data scientists are data engineers</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>My data scientists are creating really complicated data pipelines</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Jesse must not know what he’s talking about</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>...you probably have a data engineer in the background who isn’t getting any limelight.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Similar to when <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2017/03/what-happens-when-you-hire-a-data-scientist-without-a-data-engineer/\">data scientists quit</a> without a data engineer, data engineers who don’t get recognition and appreciation will quit. Don’t kid yourself; there’s an equally hot job market for qualified data engineers as there is for data scientists.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Data science only happens with a little help from our friends</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6rJia\"><img alt=\"myth of Atlas\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure2-7dadc453228ac1fdfe14ee11d4e43323.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 2. </span>Even the Italians knew the importance of data engineers in the 1400s.

He was punished by having to hold up the world/sky/celestial spheres. The earth only exists in its current form because Atlas holds it up.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In a similar way, data engineers hold up the world of data science. There isn’t much thought or credit that goes to the person holding up the world, but there should be. All levels of an organization should understand that data science is only enabled through the work of the data engineering team.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Data scientists aren’t data engineers</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That brings us to why data scientists think they’re data engineers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A few caveats to head off comments before we continue:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>I think data scientists are really smart, and I enjoy working with them.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>I’m wondering if this intelligence causes a higher IQ Dunning-Kruger effect.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Some of the best data engineers I’ve known have been data scientists, though this number is very small.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>There is a consistent overestimation when assessing our own skills.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-32ri8\"><img alt=\"Empirical diagram of data scientists’ perceived data engineering skills versus their actual skills\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure3-fc72719498859c6a50ac911952e1d920.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 3. </span>Empirical diagram of data scientists’ perceived data engineering skills versus their actual skills.

It’s an interesting social experiment in biases. Most data scientists over assessed their own data engineering abilities. Some gave an accurate assessment, but none of them gave a lower assessment than their actual ability.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are two things missing from this diagram:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>What is the skill level of data engineers?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What is the skill level needed for a moderately complicated data pipeline?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-q4iAV\"><img alt=\"Empirical diagram of data scientists’ and data engineers’ data engineering skills\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure4-489301cb2af38ca5cc96e4958ecf6405.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 4. </span>Empirical diagram of data scientists’ and data engineers’ data engineering skills with the skill needed to create a moderately complicated data pipeline. Illustration by Jesse Anderson, used with permission.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>From this figure, you can start to see the differences in the required data engineering abilities. In fact, I’m being more generous with the number of data scientists able to create a moderately complicated data pipeline. The reality may be that data scientists should be half of what the diagram shows.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Overall, it shows the approximate portions of the two groups who can and cannot create data pipelines. Yes, some data engineers can’t create a moderately complicated data pipeline. Conversely, most data scientists can’t, either. This comes back to the business issue at hand: organizations are giving their big data projects to individuals who lack the ability to succeed with the project.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<aside data-type=\"sidebar\" id=\"whats-a-moderately-complicated-data-pipeline-4LS2P\">\\r\\n<h3>What’s a moderately complicated data pipeline?</h3>\\r\\n<p>A moderately complicated data pipeline is one step above the bare minimum to create a <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2018/08/what-is-a-data-pipeline/\">data pipeline</a>. An example of a bare minimum is processing text files stored in HDFS/S3 with Spark. An example of a moderately complicated data pipeline is to start optimizing your storage with a correctly used NoSQL database that uses a binary format like Avro.</p>\\r\\n<p>I think data scientists are thinking that their simple data pipeline is what data engineering is. The reality is that they’re talking about hello-world levels and a far more complicated data pipeline is required. In the past, a data engineer performed the really difficult data engineering behind the scenes and the data scientists didn’t have to deal with it.</p>\\r\\n</aside>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You might think, “Good, so 20% of my data scientists can actually do this. I don\\'t need a data engineer after all.” First, remember this chart is being charitable in showing data scientists’ abilities. Remember that moderately complicated is still a pretty low bar. I need to create another diagram to show how few data scientists can handle the next step up in complexity. This is where the percentage drops to 1% or less of data scientists.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Why aren’t data scientists data engineers?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Sometimes I prefer to see the reflected manifestations of problems. These are a few examples of the manisted problems that make data scientists lack the data engineering skill set.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>University and other courses</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Data science is the hot new course out there for universities and online courses. There are all sorts of offerings out there, but virtually all of them have the same problem: they either completely lack or have one data engineering class.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When I see a new university’s data science curriculum announced, I take a look at it. Sometimes, I’ll be asked for comments on a university’s proposed data science curriculum. I give them same feedback: “Are you expecting expert programmers? Because there isn’t any coverage of the programming or systems required to even consume a data pipeline that’s been created.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The course outlines generally focus on the statistics and math required. This reflects what companies and academics think data science should look like. The real world looks rather different. The poor students are left to fend for themselves for the rest of these non-trivial learnings.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We can take a step back and look at this academically by looking at course requirements for a master’s degree in distributed systems. Obviously, a data scientist doesn’t need this level of depth, but it helps show what’s missing and the big holes in a data scientist’s skill set. There are some major deficiencies.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Data engineering != Spark</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A common misconception from data scientists—and management—is that data engineering is just writing some Spark code to process a file. Spark is a good solution for <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2019/01/the-three-components-of-a-big-data-data-pipeline/\">batch compute</a>, but it isn’t the only technology you’ll need. A big data solution will require <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/learning/on-complexity-in-big-data\">10-30 different technologies</a> all working together.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This sort of thinking lies at the heart of big data failures. Management thinks they have a new silver bullet to kill all of their big data problems. The reality is far more complicated than that.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When I mentor an organization on big data, I check for this misconception at all layers of the organization. If it does exist, I make sure I talk about all of the technologies they’ll need. This removes the misconception that there’s an easy button in big data and there’s a single technology to solve all of it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Where is the code from?</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Sometimes data scientists will tell me how easy data engineering is. I’ll get them to tell me how and why they think that. “I can get all the code I need from StackOverflow or Reddit. If I need to create something from scratch, I can copy someone’s design in a conference talk or a whitepaper.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To the non-engineer, this might seem OK. To the engineer, this starts major alarm bells. The legal issues aside, this isn’t engineering. There are very few cookie-cutter problems in big data. Everything after “hello world” has more complexity that needs a data engineer because there isn\\'t a cookie-cutter approach to dealing with it. Getting your design copied from a white paper could lead to a <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2017/10/on-cheating-with-big-data/\">poor performing design or worse</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I’ve dealt with a few data science teams who’ve tried this monkey-see-monkey-do approach. It doesn’t work well. This is due to big data’s <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/learning/on-complexity-in-big-data\">spike in complexity</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2017/07/this-is-useless-without-use-cases/\">extreme focus on use cases</a>. The data science team will often drop the project as it exceeds their data engineering abilities.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Put simply, there\\'s a big difference between “I can copy code from stackoverflow” or “I can modify something that\\'s already been written” and “I can create this system from scratch.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Personally, I’m worried that data science teams are going to be these sources of massive technical debt that squelches big data productivity in organizations. By the time it’s found out, the technical debt will be so high it might be infeasible to correct it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>What’s the longest their code has been in production?</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A core difference for data scientists is their depth. This depth is shown in two ways. What’s the longest time their code been in production—or has it ever been in production? What is the longest, largest, or most complicated program they have ever written?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This isn’t about gamesmanship or who’s better; it’s showing if they know what happens when you put something in production and how to maintain code. Writing a 20-line program is comparatively easy. Writing 1,000 lines of code that’s maintainable and coherent is another situation all together. People who’ve never written more than 20 lines don’t understand the miles of difference in maintainability. All of their complaints about Java verbosity or why programming best practices need to be used come into focus with large software projects.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Moving fast and breaking things works well when evaluating and discovering data. It requires a different and more intense level when working with code that goes into production. It’s for reasons like these that most data scientist’s code gets rewritten before it goes into production.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>When they design a distributed system</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One way to know the difference between data scientists and data engineers is to see what happens when they write their own distributed systems. A data scientist will write one that is very math focused but performs terribly. A software engineer with a specialization in writing distributed systems will create one that performs well and is distributed (<a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2017/12/why-you-shouldnt-write-your-own-distributed-system/\">but seriously don’t write your own</a>). I’ll share a few stories of my interactions with organizations where data scientists created a distributed system.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A business unit that was made up of data scientists at my customer’s company created a distributed system. I was sent in to talk to them and get an understanding of why they created their own system and what it could do. They were doing (distributed) image processing.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I started out by asking them why they created their own distributed system. They responded that it wasn’t possible to distribute the algorithm. To validate their findings, they contracted another data scientist with a specialty in image processing. The data scientist contractor confirmed that it wasn’t possible to distribute the algorithm.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the two hours I spent with the team, it was clear that the algorithm could be distributed on a general-purpose compute engine, like Spark. It was also clear that the distributed system they wrote wouldn’t scale and had serious design flaws. By having another data scientist validate their findings instead of a qualified data engineer, they had another novice programmer validate their novice findings.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At another company run by mathematicians, they told me about the distributed system they wrote. It was written so that math problems could be run on other computers. A few things were clear after talking to them. They could have used a general-purpose compute engine and been better off. The way they were distributing and running jobs was inefficient. It was taking longer to do the RPC network traffic than it was to perform the calculation.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are commonalities to all of these stories and others I didn’t tell:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Data scientists focus on the math instead of the system. The system is there to run math instead of running math efficiently.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Data engineers know the tricks that aren’t math. We’re not trying to cancel out infinities.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>A data scientist asks, “how can I get a computer to do my math problems?” A data engineer asks, “how can I get a computer to do my math problems as fast and efficiently as possible?”</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>The organizations could have saved themselves time, money, and heartache by using a general-purpose engine instead of writing their own.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>What’s the difference?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You’ve made it this far and I hope I’ve convinced you: data scientists are not data engineers. But really, what difference does all of this make?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>The difference between a data scientist and a data engineer is the difference between an organization succeeding or failing in their big data project.</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Data science from an engineering perspective</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When I first started to work with data scientists, I was surprised at how little they begged, borrowed, and stole from the engineering side. On the engineering front, we have some well-established best practices that weren’t being used on the data science side. A few of these are:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Source control</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Continuous integration</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Project management frameworks like Agile or Scrum</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>IDEs</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Bug tracking</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Code reviews</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Commenting code</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You saw me offhandedly mention the technical debt I’ve seen in data science teams. Let me elaborate on why I’m so worried about this. When I start pushing on a data science team to use best practices, I get two answers: “we know and we’re going to implement that later” or “we don’t need these heavyweight engineering practices. We’re agile and nimble. These models won’t go into production yet.” The best practices never get implemented and that model goes straight into production. Each one of these issues leads to a compounding of technical debt.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Code quality</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Would you put your intern’s code into production? If you’re in management, go ask your VP of engineering if they’ll put a second-year computer science student’s code into production. You might get a vehement no. Or they might say after the code was reviewed by other members of the team.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Are you going to put your data scientist’s code into production? Part of the thrust of this article is that data scientists are often novices at programming—at best—and their code is going into production. Take a look back up at the best practices that data science teams aren’t doing. There are no checks and balances to keep amateur code from going into production.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Why did they get good?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I want to end this by addressing the people who are still thinking their data scientists are data engineers. Or those data scientists who are also qualified data engineers. I want to restate that you can see from the figure it is possible, just not probable.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If this is true, I’d like you to think about why this happened.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In my experience, this happens when the ratio of data scientists to data engineers is well out of alignment. This happens when the ratio is inverted and there are zero data engineers in the organization. There should be more like two to five data engineers per data scientist. This ratio is needed because more time goes into the data engineering side than the data science.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When teams lack the right ratio, they’re making poor use of their data scientists’ time. Data scientists tend to get stuck on the programming parts that data engineers are proficient in. I’ve seen too many data scientists spend days on something that would take a data engineer an hour. This incorrectly perceived and solved problem leads organizations to hire more data scientists instead of hiring the right people who make the process more efficient.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Other times, they’re misunderstanding what a <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2018/06/the-two-types-of-data-engineering/\">data engineer is</a>. Having unqualified or the wrong type of data engineer is just as bad. You need to make sure you’re getting qualified help. This leads to the fallacy that you don’t need a data engineer because the ones you’ve worked with aren’t competent.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I’m often asked by management how they should get their data scientists to be more technically proficient. I respond that this is more a question of should the data scientists become more technically proficient. This is important for several reasons:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>There’s a low point of diminishing returns for a data science team that isn’t very technical to begin with. They can study for months, but may never get much better.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>It assumes that a data scientist is a data engineer and that isn’t correct. It would be better to target the one or two individuals on the data science team with the innate abilities to get better.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Is there an ROI to this improvement? If the data science team gets better, what could it do better or different?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>It assumes the highest value is to improve the data science team. The better investment may be in improving the data engineering team and facilitating better communication and relations between the data science and data engineering teams.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>It assumes that the data scientists actually want to improve technically. I’ve found that data scientists consider data engineering a means to an end. By doing the data engineering work, they get to do the fun data science stuff.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>What should we do?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Given that a data scientist is not a data engineer, what should we do? First and foremost, we have to understand what data scientists and data engineers do. We have to realize this isn’t a focus on titles and limiting people based on that. This is about a fundamental difference in what each person is good at and their core strengths.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Having a data scientist do data engineering tasks is fraught with failure. Conversely, having a data engineer do data science is fraught with failure. If your organization is trying to do data science, you need both people. Each person fulfills a complementary and necessary role.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For larger organizations, you will start to see the need for people who split the difference between the data scientist and data engineer skill sets. I recommend the management team look at creating a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/data-engineers-vs-data-scientists\">machine learning engineer</a> title and hiring for it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Success with big data</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As you’ve seen here, the path to success with big data isn’t just technical—there are <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2018/11/creating-a-data-engineering-culture/\">critical management parts</a>. Misunderstanding the nature of data scientists and data engineers is just one of those. If you’re having trouble with your big data projects, don’t just look for technical reasons. The underlying issue may be a management or team failure.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As you’re doing a root cause analysis of why a big data project stalled or failed, don’t just look at or blame the technology. Also, don’t just take the data science team’s explanation because they may not have enough experience to know or understand why it failed. Instead, you’ll need to go deeper—and often more painfully—to look at the management or team failings that led to a project failure.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Failures like these form a repeating and continuous pattern. You can move to the newest technology, but you’re just fixing the systemic issues. Only by fixing the root issue can you start to be successful.</p>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/why-a-data-scientist-is-not-a-data-engineer\\'>Why a data scientist is not a data engineer.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/vRnLXKurjtg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

I talked about their skills and common starting points.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>An interesting thing happened: the data scientists started pushing back, arguing that they are, in fact, as skilled as data engineers at data engineering. That was interesting because the data engineers didn’t push back saying they’re data scientists.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So, I’ve spent the past few months gathering data and observing the behaviors of data scientists in their natural habitat. This post will offer more information about why a data scientist is not a data engineer.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Why does this even matter?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Some people complained that this data scientist versus data engineer is a mere focus on titles. “Titles shouldn’t hold people back from learning or doing new things,” they argued. I agree; learn as much as you can. Just know that your learning may only scratch the surface of what’s necessary to put something in production. Otherwise, this leads to failure with big data projects.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It’s also feeding into the management level at companies. They’re hiring data scientists <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2017/03/what-happens-when-you-hire-a-data-scientist-without-a-data-engineer/\">expecting them</a> to be data engineers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I’ve heard this same story from a number of companies. They all play out the same: a company decides that data science is the way to get VC money, tons of ROI, mad street cred in their business circle, or some other reasons. This decision happens at C-level or VP-level. Let’s call this C-level person Alice.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The company goes on an exhaustive search to find the best data scientist ever. Let’s call this data scientist Bob.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It’s Bob’s first day. Alice comes up to Bob and excitedly tells him about all the projects she has in mind.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“That’s great. Where are these data pipelines and where is your Spark cluster?” Bob asks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Alice responds, “That’s what we’re expecting you to do. We hired you to do data science.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“I don’t know how to do any of that,” says Bob.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Alice looks at him quizzically, “But you’re a data scientist. Right? This is what you do.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“No, I use the data pipelines and data products that are already created.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Alice goes back to her office to figure out what happened. She stares at overly simplistic diagrams like the one shown in Figure 1 and can’t figure out why Bob can’t do the simple big data tasks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6KGiJ\"><img alt=\"venn diagram with data scientists and data engineers\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure1-42ac4b8503ed9b17c941d48f6c81f147.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>Overly simplistic venn diagram with data scientists and data engineers.

Later on, we’ll talk about the data scientists themselves.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Let’s face it. Data engineering is not in the limelight. It isn’t being proclaimed as the best job of the 21st century. It isn’t getting all of the media buzz. Conferences aren’t telling CxOs about the virtues of data engineering. If you only look at the cursory message, it’s all about data science and hiring data scientists.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This is starting to change. We have conferences on data engineering. There is a gradual recognition of the need for data engineering. I’m hoping pieces like this one shed light on this necessity. I’m hoping my body of work will educate organizations on this critical need.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Recognition and appreciation</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Even when organizations have data science and data engineering teams, there is still a lack of appreciation for the work that went into the data engineering side.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You even see this lack of credit during conference talks. The data scientist is talking about what they’ve created. I can see the extensive data engineering that went into their model, but it’s never called out during the talk. I don’t expect the talk to cover it in detail, but it would be nice to acknowledge the work that went into enabling their creation. Management and beginners to data science perceive that everything was possible with the data scientist’s skill set.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>How to get appreciation</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Lately, I’ve been getting questions from data engineers on how to get into their company’s limelight. They’re feeling that when a data scientist goes to show their latest creation, they’re either taking all of the credit or they’re given all of the credit by the management. Their basic question is: “How can I get the data scientists to stop taking credit for something that was both of our work?”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That’s a valid question from what I’m seeing at companies. Management doesn’t realize (and it isn’t socialized) the data engineering work that goes into all things data science. If you’re reading this and you’re thinking:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>My data scientists are data engineers</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>My data scientists are creating really complicated data pipelines</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Jesse must not know what he’s talking about</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>...you probably have a data engineer in the background who isn’t getting any limelight.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Similar to when <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2017/03/what-happens-when-you-hire-a-data-scientist-without-a-data-engineer/\">data scientists quit</a> without a data engineer, data engineers who don’t get recognition and appreciation will quit. Don’t kid yourself; there’s an equally hot job market for qualified data engineers as there is for data scientists.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Data science only happens with a little help from our friends</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6rJia\"><img alt=\"myth of Atlas\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure2-7dadc453228ac1fdfe14ee11d4e43323.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 2. </span>Even the Italians knew the importance of data engineers in the 1400s.

He was punished by having to hold up the world/sky/celestial spheres. The earth only exists in its current form because Atlas holds it up.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In a similar way, data engineers hold up the world of data science. There isn’t much thought or credit that goes to the person holding up the world, but there should be. All levels of an organization should understand that data science is only enabled through the work of the data engineering team.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Data scientists aren’t data engineers</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That brings us to why data scientists think they’re data engineers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A few caveats to head off comments before we continue:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>I think data scientists are really smart, and I enjoy working with them.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>I’m wondering if this intelligence causes a higher IQ Dunning-Kruger effect.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Some of the best data engineers I’ve known have been data scientists, though this number is very small.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>There is a consistent overestimation when assessing our own skills.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-32ri8\"><img alt=\"Empirical diagram of data scientists’ perceived data engineering skills versus their actual skills\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure3-fc72719498859c6a50ac911952e1d920.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 3. </span>Empirical diagram of data scientists’ perceived data engineering skills versus their actual skills. Illustration by Jesse Anderson, used with permission.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In talking to data scientists about their data engineering skills, I’ve found their self-assessments to vary wildly. It’s an interesting social experiment in biases. Most data scientists over assessed their own data engineering abilities. Some gave an accurate assessment, but none of them gave a lower assessment than their actual ability.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are two things missing from this diagram:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>What is the skill level of data engineers?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>What is the skill level needed for a moderately complicated data pipeline?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-q4iAV\"><img alt=\"Empirical diagram of data scientists’ and data engineers’ data engineering skills\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure4-489301cb2af38ca5cc96e4958ecf6405.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 4. </span>Empirical diagram of data scientists’ and data engineers’ data engineering skills with the skill needed to create a moderately complicated data pipeline. Illustration by Jesse Anderson, used with permission.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>From this figure, you can start to see the differences in the required data engineering abilities. In fact, I’m being more generous with the number of data scientists able to create a moderately complicated data pipeline. The reality may be that data scientists should be half of what the diagram shows.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Overall, it shows the approximate portions of the two groups who can and cannot create data pipelines. Yes, some data engineers can’t create a moderately complicated data pipeline. Conversely, most data scientists can’t, either. This comes back to the business issue at hand: organizations are giving their big data projects to individuals who lack the ability to succeed with the project.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<aside data-type=\"sidebar\" id=\"whats-a-moderately-complicated-data-pipeline-4LS2P\">\\r\\n<h3>What’s a moderately complicated data pipeline?</h3>\\r\\n<p>A moderately complicated data pipeline is one step above the bare minimum to create a <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2018/08/what-is-a-data-pipeline/\">data pipeline</a>. An example of a bare minimum is processing text files stored in HDFS/S3 with Spark. An example of a moderately complicated data pipeline is to start optimizing your storage with a correctly used NoSQL database that uses a binary format like Avro.</p>\\r\\n<p>I think data scientists are thinking that their simple data pipeline is what data engineering is. The reality is that they’re talking about hello-world levels and a far more complicated data pipeline is required. In the past, a data engineer performed the really difficult data engineering behind the scenes and the data scientists didn’t have to deal with it.</p>\\r\\n</aside>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You might think, “Good, so 20% of my data scientists can actually do this. I don\\'t need a data engineer after all.” First, remember this chart is being charitable in showing data scientists’ abilities. Remember that moderately complicated is still a pretty low bar. I need to create another diagram to show how few data scientists can handle the next step up in complexity. This is where the percentage drops to 1% or less of data scientists.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Why aren’t data scientists data engineers?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Sometimes I prefer to see the reflected manifestations of problems. These are a few examples of the manisted problems that make data scientists lack the data engineering skill set.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>University and other courses</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Data science is the hot new course out there for universities and online courses. There are all sorts of offerings out there, but virtually all of them have the same problem: they either completely lack or have one data engineering class.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When I see a new university’s data science curriculum announced, I take a look at it. Sometimes, I’ll be asked for comments on a university’s proposed data science curriculum. I give them same feedback: “Are you expecting expert programmers? Because there isn’t any coverage of the programming or systems required to even consume a data pipeline that’s been created.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The course outlines generally focus on the statistics and math required. This reflects what companies and academics think data science should look like. The real world looks rather different. The poor students are left to fend for themselves for the rest of these non-trivial learnings.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We can take a step back and look at this academically by looking at course requirements for a master’s degree in distributed systems. Obviously, a data scientist doesn’t need this level of depth, but it helps show what’s missing and the big holes in a data scientist’s skill set. There are some major deficiencies.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Data engineering != Spark</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A common misconception from data scientists—and management—is that data engineering is just writing some Spark code to process a file. Spark is a good solution for <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2019/01/the-three-components-of-a-big-data-data-pipeline/\">batch compute</a>, but it isn’t the only technology you’ll need. A big data solution will require <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/learning/on-complexity-in-big-data\">10-30 different technologies</a> all working together.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This sort of thinking lies at the heart of big data failures. Management thinks they have a new silver bullet to kill all of their big data problems. The reality is far more complicated than that.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When I mentor an organization on big data, I check for this misconception at all layers of the organization. If it does exist, I make sure I talk about all of the technologies they’ll need. This removes the misconception that there’s an easy button in big data and there’s a single technology to solve all of it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Where is the code from?</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Sometimes data scientists will tell me how easy data engineering is. I’ll get them to tell me how and why they think that. “I can get all the code I need from StackOverflow or Reddit. If I need to create something from scratch, I can copy someone’s design in a conference talk or a whitepaper.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To the non-engineer, this might seem OK. To the engineer, this starts major alarm bells. The legal issues aside, this isn’t engineering. There are very few cookie-cutter problems in big data. Everything after “hello world” has more complexity that needs a data engineer because there isn\\'t a cookie-cutter approach to dealing with it. Getting your design copied from a white paper could lead to a <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2017/10/on-cheating-with-big-data/\">poor performing design or worse</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I’ve dealt with a few data science teams who’ve tried this monkey-see-monkey-do approach. It doesn’t work well. This is due to big data’s <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/learning/on-complexity-in-big-data\">spike in complexity</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2017/07/this-is-useless-without-use-cases/\">extreme focus on use cases</a>. The data science team will often drop the project as it exceeds their data engineering abilities.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Put simply, there\\'s a big difference between “I can copy code from stackoverflow” or “I can modify something that\\'s already been written” and “I can create this system from scratch.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Personally, I’m worried that data science teams are going to be these sources of massive technical debt that squelches big data productivity in organizations. By the time it’s found out, the technical debt will be so high it might be infeasible to correct it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>What’s the longest their code has been in production?</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A core difference for data scientists is their depth. This depth is shown in two ways. What’s the longest time their code been in production—or has it ever been in production? What is the longest, largest, or most complicated program they have ever written?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This isn’t about gamesmanship or who’s better; it’s showing if they know what happens when you put something in production and how to maintain code. Writing a 20-line program is comparatively easy. Writing 1,000 lines of code that’s maintainable and coherent is another situation all together. People who’ve never written more than 20 lines don’t understand the miles of difference in maintainability. All of their complaints about Java verbosity or why programming best practices need to be used come into focus with large software projects.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Moving fast and breaking things works well when evaluating and discovering data. It requires a different and more intense level when working with code that goes into production. It’s for reasons like these that most data scientist’s code gets rewritten before it goes into production.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>When they design a distributed system</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One way to know the difference between data scientists and data engineers is to see what happens when they write their own distributed systems. A data scientist will write one that is very math focused but performs terribly. A software engineer with a specialization in writing distributed systems will create one that performs well and is distributed (<a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2017/12/why-you-shouldnt-write-your-own-distributed-system/\">but seriously don’t write your own</a>). I’ll share a few stories of my interactions with organizations where data scientists created a distributed system.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A business unit that was made up of data scientists at my customer’s company created a distributed system. I was sent in to talk to them and get an understanding of why they created their own system and what it could do. They were doing (distributed) image processing.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I started out by asking them why they created their own distributed system. They responded that it wasn’t possible to distribute the algorithm. To validate their findings, they contracted another data scientist with a specialty in image processing. The data scientist contractor confirmed that it wasn’t possible to distribute the algorithm.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the two hours I spent with the team, it was clear that the algorithm could be distributed on a general-purpose compute engine, like Spark. It was also clear that the distributed system they wrote wouldn’t scale and had serious design flaws. By having another data scientist validate their findings instead of a qualified data engineer, they had another novice programmer validate their novice findings.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At another company run by mathematicians, they told me about the distributed system they wrote. It was written so that math problems could be run on other computers. A few things were clear after talking to them. They could have used a general-purpose compute engine and been better off. The way they were distributing and running jobs was inefficient. It was taking longer to do the RPC network traffic than it was to perform the calculation.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are commonalities to all of these stories and others I didn’t tell:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Data scientists focus on the math instead of the system. The system is there to run math instead of running math efficiently.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Data engineers know the tricks that aren’t math. We’re not trying to cancel out infinities.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>A data scientist asks, “how can I get a computer to do my math problems?” A data engineer asks, “how can I get a computer to do my math problems as fast and efficiently as possible?”</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>The organizations could have saved themselves time, money, and heartache by using a general-purpose engine instead of writing their own.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>What’s the difference?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You’ve made it this far and I hope I’ve convinced you: data scientists are not data engineers. But really, what difference does all of this make?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>The difference between a data scientist and a data engineer is the difference between an organization succeeding or failing in their big data project.</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Data science from an engineering perspective</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When I first started to work with data scientists, I was surprised at how little they begged, borrowed, and stole from the engineering side. On the engineering front, we have some well-established best practices that weren’t being used on the data science side. A few of these are:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Source control</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Continuous integration</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Project management frameworks like Agile or Scrum</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>IDEs</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Bug tracking</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Code reviews</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Commenting code</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You saw me offhandedly mention the technical debt I’ve seen in data science teams. Let me elaborate on why I’m so worried about this. When I start pushing on a data science team to use best practices, I get two answers: “we know and we’re going to implement that later” or “we don’t need these heavyweight engineering practices. We’re agile and nimble. These models won’t go into production yet.” The best practices never get implemented and that model goes straight into production. Each one of these issues leads to a compounding of technical debt.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Code quality</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Would you put your intern’s code into production? If you’re in management, go ask your VP of engineering if they’ll put a second-year computer science student’s code into production. You might get a vehement no. Or they might say after the code was reviewed by other members of the team.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Are you going to put your data scientist’s code into production? Part of the thrust of this article is that data scientists are often novices at programming—at best—and their code is going into production. Take a look back up at the best practices that data science teams aren’t doing. There are no checks and balances to keep amateur code from going into production.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Why did they get good?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I want to end this by addressing the people who are still thinking their data scientists are data engineers. Or those data scientists who are also qualified data engineers. I want to restate that you can see from the figure it is possible, just not probable.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If this is true, I’d like you to think about why this happened.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In my experience, this happens when the ratio of data scientists to data engineers is well out of alignment. This happens when the ratio is inverted and there are zero data engineers in the organization. There should be more like two to five data engineers per data scientist. This ratio is needed because more time goes into the data engineering side than the data science.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When teams lack the right ratio, they’re making poor use of their data scientists’ time. Data scientists tend to get stuck on the programming parts that data engineers are proficient in. I’ve seen too many data scientists spend days on something that would take a data engineer an hour. This incorrectly perceived and solved problem leads organizations to hire more data scientists instead of hiring the right people who make the process more efficient.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Other times, they’re misunderstanding what a <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2018/06/the-two-types-of-data-engineering/\">data engineer is</a>. Having unqualified or the wrong type of data engineer is just as bad. You need to make sure you’re getting qualified help. This leads to the fallacy that you don’t need a data engineer because the ones you’ve worked with aren’t competent.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I’m often asked by management how they should get their data scientists to be more technically proficient. I respond that this is more a question of should the data scientists become more technically proficient. This is important for several reasons:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>There’s a low point of diminishing returns for a data science team that isn’t very technical to begin with. They can study for months, but may never get much better.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>It assumes that a data scientist is a data engineer and that isn’t correct. It would be better to target the one or two individuals on the data science team with the innate abilities to get better.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Is there an ROI to this improvement? If the data science team gets better, what could it do better or different?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>It assumes the highest value is to improve the data science team. The better investment may be in improving the data engineering team and facilitating better communication and relations between the data science and data engineering teams.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>It assumes that the data scientists actually want to improve technically. I’ve found that data scientists consider data engineering a means to an end. By doing the data engineering work, they get to do the fun data science stuff.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>What should we do?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Given that a data scientist is not a data engineer, what should we do? First and foremost, we have to understand what data scientists and data engineers do. We have to realize this isn’t a focus on titles and limiting people based on that. This is about a fundamental difference in what each person is good at and their core strengths.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Having a data scientist do data engineering tasks is fraught with failure. Conversely, having a data engineer do data science is fraught with failure. If your organization is trying to do data science, you need both people. Each person fulfills a complementary and necessary role.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For larger organizations, you will start to see the need for people who split the difference between the data scientist and data engineer skill sets. I recommend the management team look at creating a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/data-engineers-vs-data-scientists\">machine learning engineer</a> title and hiring for it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Success with big data</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As you’ve seen here, the path to success with big data isn’t just technical—there are <a href=\"http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2018/11/creating-a-data-engineering-culture/\">critical management parts</a>. Misunderstanding the nature of data scientists and data engineers is just one of those. If you’re having trouble with your big data projects, don’t just look for technical reasons. The underlying issue may be a management or team failure.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As you’re doing a root cause analysis of why a big data project stalled or failed, don’t just look at or blame the technology. Also, don’t just take the data science team’s explanation because they may not have enough experience to know or understand why it failed. Instead, you’ll need to go deeper—and often more painfully—to look at the management or team failings that led to a project failure.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Failures like these form a repeating and continuous pattern. You can move to the newest technology, but you’re just fixing the systemic issues. Only by fixing the root issue can you start to be successful.</p>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/why-a-data-scientist-is-not-a-data-engineer\\'>Why a data scientist is not a data engineer.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/vRnLXKurjtg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>',\n",

There are some techniques for removing bias from word embeddings. I won’t go into them in detail, but for the sake of argument, imagine taking the texts of every English language newspaper and replacing “he,” “she,” and other gender-specific words with “they” or “them.” (Real techniques are more sophisticated, of course.)

I suspect the connections are much more complex, but something along those lines is probably happening. It’s not a problem if “caring” professions cluster together—but what about the connections between these words and other words?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Gonen and Goldberg point out that explicit male/female associations aren’t really the issue: “algorithmic discrimination is more likely to happen by associating one implicitly gendered term with other implicitly gendered terms, or by picking up on gender-specific regularities in the corpus by learning to condition on gender-biased words, and generalizing to other gender-biased words (i.e., a resume classifier that will learn to favor male over female candidates based on stereotypical cues in an existing—and biased—resume data set, despite being “oblivious” to gender).” That is, an AI that screens job applications for a “programming” position could be biased against women without knowing anything explicit about gender; it would just know that “programmer” clusters with certain words that happen to appear more often in resumes that come from men.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So let’s ask some other difficult questions. Would de-biasing language around race and ethnicity achieve the same (lack of) result? I would like to see that studied; Robyn Speer’s work, described in “<a href=\"http://blog.conceptnet.io/posts/2017/how-to-make-a-racist-ai-without-really-trying/\">How To Make a Racist AI Without Really Trying</a>,” suggests that de-biasing for race is at least partially successful; though, Speer asks: “Can we stop worrying about algorithmic racism? No. Have we made the problem a lot smaller? Definitely.” I hope she’s right; I’m less convinced now than I was a few months ago. I can certainly imagine racial stereotypes persisting even after bias has been removed. What about anti-semitic language? What about other stereotypes? One researcher I know discovered an enterprise security application that was biased against salespeople, who were considered more likely to engage in risky behavior.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We’re uncovering biases that are basic to our use of language. It shouldn’t surprise anyone that these biases are built in to the way we communicate, and that they go fairly deep. We can remove gender as a factor in word embeddings, but that doesn’t help much. Turkish, for example, doesn’t have gendered pronouns, a fact that has revealed <a href=\"https://qz.com/1141122/google-translates-gender-bias-pairs-he-with-hardworking-and-she-with-lazy-and-other-examples/\">gender bias in automated translation</a>, where gender-neutral Turkish sentences are translated as gender-specific English sentences. But no one would claim that gender bias doesn’t exist in Turkish; it’s just encoded differently. Likewise, we can remove race and ethnicity as a factor in word embeddings, but that, at best, leaves us with a smaller problem. Language is only a symptom of bigger issues. These biases are part of what we are, and these word associations, including the associations we’d prefer to disown, are part of what makes language work.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The problem we’re facing in natural language processing (as in any application of machine learning) is that <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-we-learn-from-ais-biases\">fairness is aspirational and forward looking</a>; data can only be historical, and therefore necessarily reflects the biases and prejudices of the past. Learning how to de-bias our applications is progress, but the only real solution is to become better people. That’s more easily said than done; it’s not clear that being more conscious about how we talk will remove these hidden biases, any more than rewriting “he” and “she” as “they.” And being too conscious of how we talk can easily lead to a constant state of self-censorship that makes conversation impossible, and specifically the kinds of conversations we need to make progress.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If there’s any one thing that will remove those biases, it is being more aware of how we act. Returning to Gonem and Goldberg’s study of professional stereotypes: the way to change those problematic word embeddings permanently isn’t to tweak the data, but to make hiring decisions that aren’t based on stereotypes, and to treat the people we hire fairly and with respect, regardless of gender (or race or ethnicity). If we act differently, our language will inevitably change to reflect our actions.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I am hopeful that machine learning will help us leave behind a biased and prejudiced past, and build a future that’s more fair and equitable. But machine learning won’t make prejudice disappear by forcing us to rely on data when the data itself is biased. And the myth that the apparent abstraction and mathematical rationality of machine learning is unbiased only lends the prestige of math and science to prejudice and stereotype. If machine learning is going to help, we’ll need to understand that progress is incremental, not absolute. Machine learning is a tool, not a magic wand, and it’s capable of being misused. It can hold a mirror to our biases, or it can hide them.

Along the way, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-are-machine-learning-engineers\">we described a new job role and title—machine learning engineer</a>—focused on creating data products and making data science work in production, a role that was beginning to emerge in the San Francisco Bay Area two years ago. At that time, there weren’t any popular tools aimed at solving the problems facing teams tasked with putting machine learning into practice.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>About 10 months ago, Databricks announced <a href=\"https://mlflow.org/\">MLflow</a>, a new open source project for managing machine learning development (full disclosure: Ben Lorica is an advisor to Databricks). We thought that given the lack of clear open source alternatives, MLflow had a decent chance of gaining traction, and this has proven to be the case. Over a relatively short time period, MLflow has garnered more than 3,300 stars on GitHub and 80 contributors from more than 40 companies. Most significantly, more than 200 companies are now using MLflow.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So, why is this new open source project resonating with data scientists and machine learning engineers? Recall the following <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/julesdamji/whats-next-for-mlflow-in-2019\">key attributes of a machine learning</a> project:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Unlike traditional software where the goal is to meet a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_specification\">functional specification</a>, in ML the goal is to optimize a metric.</li>\\n\\t<li>Quality depends not just on code, but also on data, tuning, regular updates, and retraining.</li>\\n\\t<li>Those involved with ML usually want to experiment with new libraries, algorithms, and data sources—and thus, one must be able to put those new components into production.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>MLflow’s success can be attributed to a lightweight “open interface” that allows users to hook up their favorite machine learning libraries, and the availability of three components that users can pick and choose from (i.e., they can use one, two, or all three of the following):</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6nGie\"><img alt=\"MLflow components\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/image1-92b33f611d3324e705884d2896ecdcda.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>Image by Matei Zaharia; used with permission.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n<p>The fact that one can pick and choose which MLflow component(s) to use means the project is able to quickly serve the needs of a diverse set of users. Based on an upcoming survey we conducted of MLflow users, here are some of the most popular use cases:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Tracking and managing large numbers of machine learning experiments: MLflow is useful for an individual data scientist tracking his/her own experiments, but it is also designed to be used by companies with large teams of machine learning developers who are using it to track thousands of models.</li>\\n\\t<li>MLflow is being used to manage multi-step machine learning pipelines.</li>\\n\\t<li>Model packaging: companies are using MLflow to incorporate custom logic and dependencies as part of a model’s package abstraction before deploying it to their production environment (example: a recommendation system might be programmed to not display certain images to minors).</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The upcoming <a href=\"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v0.9.0\">0.9.0 release has many new features</a>, including support for database stores for the MLflow Tracking Server, which will make it easier for large teams to query and track ongoing and past experiments.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We are still in the early days for tools supporting teams developing machine learning models. Besides MLflow, there are startups like <a href=\"https://www.comet.ml/\">Comet.ml</a> and <a href=\"https://www.verta.ai/\">Verta.ai</a> that are building tools to ease similar pain points. As <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-machine-learning-means-for-software-development\">software development begins to resemble ML development</a> over the next few years, we expect to see more investments in tools.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Model governance</h2>\\n\\n<p>Companies need to look seriously at the improved tools for developing machine learning models, many of which are part of more ambitious tools suites. Machine learning can’t be limited to researchers with Ph.D.s; there aren’t enough of them. Machine learning is in the process of democratization; tools that make it possible for software developers to build and train models are essential to this process.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We’ve also said the number of machine learning models that are deployed in production will increase dramatically: many applications will be built from many models, and many organizations will want to automate many different aspects of their business. And those models will age and need to be re-trained periodically. We’ve become accustomed to the need for data governance and provenance, understanding and controlling the many\\ndatabases that are combined in a modern data-driven application. We’re now realizing the same is true for models, too. Companies will need to track the models they’re building and the models they have in production.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Startups like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bigdata/status/1111420708616204293\">Datatron</a> are beginning to use the term “model governance” to describe the task of tracking and managing models, and they are beginning to build model governance tools into their product suites. This term describes the processes that enterprises and large companies are starting to use to understand the many ML initiatives and projects teams are working on. Regulators are also signalling their interest in products that rely on AI and machine learning, thus systems for managing ML development are going to be required to comply with future legislation. Here are some of the elements that are going to play a role in building a model governance solution:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>A database for authorization and security: who has read/write access to certain models</li>\\n\\t<li>A catalog or a database that lists models, including when they were tested, trained, and deployed</li>\\n\\t<li>Metadata and artifacts needed for audits: as an example, the output from the components of MLflow will be very pertinent for audits</li>\\n\\t<li>Systems for deployment, monitoring, and alerting: who approved and pushed the model out to production, who is able to monitor its performance and receive alerts, and who is responsible for it</li>\\n\\t<li>A dashboard that provides custom views for all principals (operations, ML engineers, data scientists, business owners)</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Traditional software developers have long had tools for managing their projects. These tools serve functions like version control, library management, deployment automation, and more. Machine learning engineers know and use all those tools, but they’re not enough. We’re beginning to see the tool suits that provide the features that machine learning engineers need, including tools for model governance, tracking experiments, and packaging models so that results are repeatable. The next big step in the democratization of machine learning is making it more manageable: not simply hand-crafted artisanal solutions, but solutions that make machine learning manageable and deployable at enterprise scale.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Related resources</strong>:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>\\n<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-are-machine-learning-engineers\">“What are machine learning engineers?”</a>: a new role focused on creating data products and making data science work in production</li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-machine-learning-means-for-software-development\">“What machine learning means for software development”</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-automation-in-machine-learning\">“Deep automation in machine learning”</a></li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-is-hardcore-data-science-in-practice\">“What is hardcore data science—in practice?”</a>: the anatomy of an architecture to bring data science into production</li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-turning-machine-learning-models-into-real-products-and-services\">“Lessons learned turning machine learning models into real products and services”</a></li>\\n\\t<li>Harish Doddi on <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/simplifying-machine-learning-lifecycle-management\">“Simplifying machine learning lifecycle management”</a>\\n</li>\\n\\t<li>Jesse Anderson and Paco Nathan on <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-machine-learning-engineers-need-to-know\">“What machine learning engineers need to know”</a>\\n</li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/data-engineers-vs-data-scientists\">“Data engineers vs. data scientists”</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential\\'>Specialized tools for machine learning development and model governance are becoming essential.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/4tBUslVoW9c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",
